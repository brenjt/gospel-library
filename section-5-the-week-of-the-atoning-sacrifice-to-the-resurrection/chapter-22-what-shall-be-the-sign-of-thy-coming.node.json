Not one stone was to be left upon another: not one stone of the porch, the sanctuary, and the holy of holies of the holy house; not one stone of the court and cloisters of the temple.

With the first question, “Tell us, when shall these things be?” the disciples asked Jesus to tell them when the destruction of the temple of Herod and the slaughter and dispersion of the Jews was to take place. With the second question, “And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?” they made a request for a definitive explanation of those significant events which precede the Lord’s second coming.
