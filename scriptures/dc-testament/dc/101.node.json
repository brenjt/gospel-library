At this time the Saints who had gathered in Missouri were suffering great persecution. Mobs had driven them from their homes in Jackson County; and some of the Saints had tried to establish themselves in Van Buren, Lafayette, and Ray Counties, but persecution followed them. The main body of the Saints was at that time in Clay County, Missouri. Threats of death against individuals of the Church were many. The Saints in Jackson County had lost household furniture, clothing, livestock, and other personal property; and many of their crops had been destroyed."]],[".studySummary",["i",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.1-8"},"1–8"],", The Saints are chastened and afflicted because of their transgressions;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.9-15"},"9–15"],", The Lord’s indignation will fall upon the nations, but His people will be gathered and comforted;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.16-21"},"16–21"],", Zion and her stakes will be established;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.22-31"},"22–31"],", The nature of life during the Millennium is set forth;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.32-42"},"32–42"],", The Saints will be blessed and rewarded then;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.43-62"},"43–62"],", The parable of the nobleman and the olive trees signifies the troubles and eventual redemption of Zion;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.63-75"},"63–75"],", The Saints are to continue gathering together;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.76-80"},"76–80"],", The Lord established the Constitution of the United States;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.81-101"},"81–101"],", The Saints are to importune for the redress of grievances, according to the parable of the woman and the unjust judge."]]],[".bodyBlock",["div",{"id":"1","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.1","order":"06.05.101.12633"},["b","1"],"Verily I say unto you, concerning your brethren who have been afflicted, and",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_1a"},"persecuted"],", and",["sup","b"],["a",{"href":"fn_1b"},"cast out"],"from the land of their inheritance—"],["div",{"id":"2","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.2","order":"06.05.101.12634"},["b","2"],"I, the Lord, have suffered the",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_2a"},"affliction"],"to come upon them, wherewith they have been afflicted, in consequence of their",["sup","b"],["a",{"href":"fn_2b"},"transgressions"],";"],["div",{"id":"3","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.3","order":"06.05.101.12635"},["b","3"],"Yet I will own them, and they shall be",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_3a"},"mine"],"in that day when I shall come to make up my jewels."],["div",{"id":"4","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.4","order":"06.05.101.12636"},["b","4"],"Therefore, they must needs be",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_4a"},"chastened"],"and tried, even as",["sup","b"],["a",{"href":"fn_4b"},"Abraham"],", who was commanded to offer up his only son."],["div",{"id":"5","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.5","order":"06.05.101.12637"},["b","5"],"For all those who will not",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_5a"},"endure"],"chastening, but",["sup","b"],["a",{"href":"fn_5b"},"deny"],"me, cannot be sanctified."],["div",{"id":"6","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.6","order":"06.05.101.12638"},["b","6"],"Behold, I say unto you, there were jarrings, and",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_6a"},"contentions"],", and",["sup","b"],["a",{"href":"fn_6b"},"envyings"],", and",["sup","c"],["a",{"href":"fn_6c"},"strifes"],", and",["sup","d"],["a",{"href":"fn_6d"},"lustful"],"and covetous desires among them; therefore by these things they polluted their inheritances."],["div",{"id":"7","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.7","order":"06.05.101.12639"},["b","7"],"They were slow to",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_7a"},"hearken"],"unto the voice of the Lord their God; therefore, the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, to answer them in the day of their trouble."],["div",{"id":"8","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.8","order":"06.05.101.12640"},["b","8"],"In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel; but, in the day of their",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_8a"},"trouble"],", of necessity they",["sup","b"],["a",{"href":"fn_8b"},"feel"],"after me."],["div",{"id":"9","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.9","order":"06.05.101.12641"},["b","9"],"Verily I say unto you, notwithstanding their sins, my bowels are filled with",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_9a"},"compassion"],"towards them.
