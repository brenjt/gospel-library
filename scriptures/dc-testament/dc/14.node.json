The Whitmer family had become greatly interested in the translating of the Book of Mormon. The Prophet established his residence at the home of Peter Whitmer Sr., where he dwelt until the work of translation was carried to completion and the copyright on the forthcoming book was secured. Three of the Whitmer sons, each having received a testimony as to the genuineness of the work, became deeply concerned over the matter of their individual duty. This revelation and the two following (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/15"},"sections 15"],"and",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/16"},"16"],") were given in answer to an inquiry through the Urim and Thummim.
