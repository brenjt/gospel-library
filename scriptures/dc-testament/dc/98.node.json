This revelation came in consequence of the persecution upon the Saints in Missouri. Increased settlement of Church members in Missouri troubled some other settlers, who felt threatened by the Saints’ numbers, political and economic influence, and cultural and religious differences. In July 1833, a mob destroyed Church property, tarred and feathered two Church members, and demanded that the Saints leave Jackson County. Although some news of the problems in Missouri had no doubt reached the Prophet in Kirtland (nine hundred miles away), the seriousness of the situation could have been known to him at this date only by revelation."]],[".studySummary",["i",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.1-3"},"1–3"],", The afflictions of the Saints will be for their good;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.4-8"},"4–8"],", The Saints are to befriend the constitutional law of the land;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.9-10"},"9–10"],", Honest, wise, and good men should be supported for secular government;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.11-15"},"11–15"],", Those who lay down their lives in the Lord’s cause will have eternal life;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.16-18"},"16–18"],", Renounce war and proclaim peace;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.19-22"},"19–22"],", The Saints in Kirtland are reproved and commanded to repent;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.23-32"},"23–32"],", The Lord reveals His laws governing the persecutions and afflictions imposed on His people;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.33-38"},"33–38"],", War is justified only when the Lord commands it;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.39-48"},"39–48"],", The Saints are to forgive their enemies, who, if they repent, will also escape the Lord’s vengeance."]]],[".bodyBlock",["div",{"id":"1","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.1","order":"06.05.098.12374"},["b","1"],"Verily I say unto you my friends,",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_1a"},"fear not"],", let your hearts be comforted;
