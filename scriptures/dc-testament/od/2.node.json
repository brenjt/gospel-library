Throughout the history of the Church, people of every race and ethnicity in many countries have been baptized and have lived as faithful members of the Church. During Joseph Smith’s lifetime, a few black male members of the Church were ordained to the priesthood. Early in its history, Church leaders stopped conferring the priesthood on black males of African descent. Church records offer no clear insights into the origins of this practice. Church leaders believed that a revelation from God was needed to alter this practice and prayerfully sought guidance. The revelation came to Church President Spencer W. Kimball and was affirmed to other Church leaders in the Salt Lake Temple on June 1, 1978. The revelation removed all restrictions with regard to race that once applied to the priesthood."]]],[".bodyBlock",[".openingBlock",[".salutation","To Whom It May Concern:"]],["div",{"id":"p2","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/od/2.p2","order":".002.17767"},"On September 30, 1978, at the 148th Semiannual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the following was presented by President N. Eldon Tanner, First Counselor in the First Presidency of the Church:"],["div",{"id":"p3","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/od/2.p3","order":".002.17768"},"In early June of this year, the First Presidency announced that a revelation had been received by President Spencer W.
