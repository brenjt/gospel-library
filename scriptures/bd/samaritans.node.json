They were the descendants of (1) foreign colonists placed there by kings of Assyria and Babylonia (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/17.24"},"2 Kgs. 17:24"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/ezra/4.2,10"},"Ezra 4:2, 10"],"); (2) Israelites who escaped at the time of the captivity. The population was therefore partly Israelite and partly gentile. Their religion was also of a mixed character (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/17.24-41"},"2 Kgs. 17:24–41"],"), though they claimed, as worshippers of Jehovah, to have a share in the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/ezra/4.1-3"},"Ezra 4:1–3"],"). This claim not being allowed, they became, as the books of Ezra and Nehemiah show, bitter opponents of the Jews, and started a rival temple of their own on Mount Gerizim. When Nehemiah ejected from Jerusalem a grandson of the high priest Eliashib on account of his marriage with a heathen woman (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/neh/13.28"},"Neh. 13:28"],"), he took refuge with the Samaritans, taking with him a copy of the Pentateuch, and according to Josephus became high priest at Gerizim. There are several references in the New Testament to the antagonism between the Jews and Samaritans (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/10.5"},"Matt. 10:5"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/9.52-53"},"Luke 9:52–53"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/10.33"},"10:33"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/17.16"},"17:16"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/4.9,39"},"John 4:9, 39"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/8.48"},"8:48"],"); but the people of Samaria were included among those to whom the Apostles were directed to preach the gospel (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/1.8"},"Acts 1:8"],"), and a very successful work was done there by Philip (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/8.4-25"},"Acts 8:4–25"],")."]]],"refs":null}
