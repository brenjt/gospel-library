They seldom exceeded two stories in height. The houses of the rich were built around a court. The roofs were invariably flat and could in many cases be reached by an outside staircase, guarded by a balustrade to prevent accidents (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/deut/22.8"},"Deut. 22:8"],"). Upon the roof an upper chamber was often built, which served as a parlor or as a place for taking the midday siesta (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/judg/3.23,25"},"Judg. 3:23, 25"],"). Windows were closed in with latticework, glass being an extremely costly material. The principal articles of furniture were the bed, consisting of a rug or mattress, rolled up during the day and spread when required on the floor or on a ledge by the wall, or in summer on the roof of the house; the lampstand; and the table, with couches around it on which the guests reclined at full length.
