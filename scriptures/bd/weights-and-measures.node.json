Such terms must be interpreted in the light of the period of time in which they are used. Early systems of measurement were quite imprecise, as, for example, a bowshot (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/gen/21.16"},"Gen. 21:16"],"); a donkey load (being a “heap” of grain or a “homer”); a furrow length (source of our word",["i","furlong"],"); a day’s journey (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/num/11.31"},"Num. 11:31"],"); three days’ journey (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/gen/30.36"},"Gen. 30:36"],"; see also",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/gen/31.23"},"31:23"],"); and such other measures as span, handbreadth, cubit, fathom (a full stretch of the arms, or about 5½ to 6 feet), pace, etc. These often used as a standard a part of the human body. Furthermore, an acre was originally the amount of land that could be plowed in a day using a yoke of oxen, as in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-sam/14.14"},"1 Sam. 14:14"],". Land area was also measured by the amount of grain needed to sow it, as in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/27.16"},"Lev. 27:16"],". This system of measurement was simply not accurate enough for commercial use. Later, international trade, and subsequent political domination by the Greeks and the Romans, forced some degree of standardization for purposes of tribute, taxation, architecture, and the like. Thus the same term may vary in meaning in Old Testament and New Testament times."],["div",{"id":"p2","uri":"/scriptures/bd/weights-and-measures.p2","order":".000.3984"},"Metals were at first primarily measured by weight, whereas other things were measured by bulk or by size. Thus silver and gold were calculated by weight until coinage became popular (probably 5th century",["span.small","B.C."],", after the Babylonian exile), and then the standard shifted from weight to value. Hence, a silver coin of a certain value would not weigh the same as an equivalent value of silver measured by the earlier standard of weight.
