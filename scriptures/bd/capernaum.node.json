At the time of our Lord the district was one of the most prosperous and crowded in all Palestine. Here the Lord lived after the beginning of His ministry, so that Capernaum is called “his own city” (compare",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/9.1"},"Matt. 9:1"],"with",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/2.1"},"Mark 2:1"],"). It was the home of Peter and Andrew (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/1.29"},"Mark 1:29"],") and of Matthew (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/9.9"},"Matt. 9:9"],"). Many of our Lord’s miracles were worked here (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/8.5,14"},"Matt. 8:5, 14"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/9.1"},"9:1"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/1.21,30"},"Mark 1:21, 30"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/2.1"},"2:1"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/4.31-35,38"},"Luke 4:31–35, 38"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/5.18"},"5:18"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/7.1"},"7:1"],"). In the synagogue at Capernaum was spoken the wonderful discourse found in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/6.59"},"John 6:59"],".
