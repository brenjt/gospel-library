The war was primarily over how and in what manner the plan of salvation would be administered to the forthcoming human family upon the earth. The issues involved such things as agency, how to gain salvation, and who should be the Redeemer. The war broke out because one-third of the spirits refused to accept the appointment of Jesus Christ as the Savior. Such a refusal was a rebellion against the Father’s plan of redemption. It was evident that if given agency, some persons would fall short of complete salvation; Lucifer and his followers wanted salvation to come automatically to all who passed through mortality, without regard to individual preference, agency, or voluntary dedication (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/isa/14.12-20"},"Isa. 14:12–20"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/10.18"},"Luke 10:18"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/rev/12.4-13"},"Rev. 12:4–13"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.36-38"},"D&C 29:36–38"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.1-4"},"Moses 4:1–4"],").
