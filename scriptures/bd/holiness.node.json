Similarly a holy person meant one who held a sacred office. The Israelites were a holy people because they stood in a special relationship to Jehovah. Under the guidance of the Prophets it was seen that what distinguished Jehovah from the gods of the heathen was His personal character. The word",["i","holy"],"therefore came to refer to moral character (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/11.44"},"Lev. 11:44"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19.2"},"19:2"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/21.8"},"21:8"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/isa/6.3-8"},"Isa. 6:3–8"],"). Israel must be holy in character because the God of Israel was holy (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/jer/7.4-7"},"Jer. 7:4–7"],"; see also",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48"},"Matt. 5:48"],"). The Law of Holiness (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/17?span=17-26"},"Lev. 17–26"],") shows how the attempt was made by means of ceremonial observances to secure this holiness of character. The attempt failed because the later Jews observed the letter and neglected the spirit; they attached more importance to the ceremonial than to the moral; and the result was a lapse into formalism. But in the writings of the Prophets it is clearly laid down that the value of worship in the eyes of God depends upon the personal character of the worshipper."]]],"refs":null}
