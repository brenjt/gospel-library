The significance of Corneliusâ€™s baptism is that he was probably the first Gentile to come into the Church not having previously become a proselyte to Judaism (see",["i",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bd/proselytes"},"Proselytes"]],").

It is notable that this major event in the missionary activity of the Church was done through the ministry of Peter, the chief Apostle, who held the keys of the kingdom of God at that time on the earth."]]],"refs":null}
