It is only possible to indicate here a few of the chief facts. He was known in early life as Saul; his Latin name Paul is first mentioned at the beginning of his gentile ministry (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/13.9"},"Acts 13:9"],"). He belonged to Tarsus, in Cilicia (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/9.11"},"Acts 9:11"],"); was a Pharisee and a pupil of Gamaliel (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/22.3"},"Acts 22:3"],"); was active in the persecution of Christians (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/8.3"},"Acts 8:3"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/26.10"},"26:10"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/gal/1.13"},"Gal. 1:13"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/philip/3.6"},"Philip. 3:6"],"); and took part in the martyrdom of Stephen (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/7.58"},"Acts 7:58"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/8.1"},"8:1"],"). He started for Damascus for the purpose of further persecution (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/9.1"},"Acts 9:1"],") and on the road saw a vision of the Lord Jesus, which changed the whole current of his life (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/9.4-19"},"Acts 9:4–19"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/22.7"},"22:7"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/26.14"},"26:14"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/gal/1.15-16"},"Gal. 1:15–16"],"). After his baptism by Ananias (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/9.18"},"Acts 9:18"],"), he retired into Arabia (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/gal/1.17"},"Gal. 1:17"],") and then returned to Damascus, where he preached (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/9.19-25"},"Acts 9:19–25"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/2-cor/11.32"},"2 Cor. 11:32"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/gal/1.17-18"},"Gal. 1:17–18"],"). Being compelled to flee, about three years after his conversion he went to Jerusalem, where he stayed 15 days, Barnabas introducing him to Peter and James (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/9.26-30"},"Acts 9:26–30"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/gal/1.18-19"},"Gal. 1:18–19"],"). Being in danger, he retired to Tarsus (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/9.29-30"},"Acts 9:29–30"],") and there remained six or seven years, preaching in Syria and Cilicia (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/gal/1.21-24"},"Gal. 1:21–24"],"). He was then brought by Barnabas to Antioch (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/11.26"},"Acts 11:26"],") and after one year paid a visit to Jerusalem (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/11.29-30"},"Acts 11:29–30"],"). After two more years’ work in Antioch, he started with Barnabas and Mark on his first missionary journey (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/13.1?span=13.1-14.26"},"Acts 13:1–14:26"],"). Then came another visit to Jerusalem with Barnabas to attend a conference with the other Apostles (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/15.1-33"},"Acts 15:1–33"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/gal/2.1-10"},"Gal. 2:1–10"],"), after which they returned to Antioch (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/15.35"},"Acts 15:35"],"). He then started on his second missionary journey (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/15.36?span=15.36-18.22"},"Acts 15:36–18:22"],"), which lasted about three years and ended with a visit to Jerusalem. After a short stay in Antioch, Paul began his third journey, which occupied about 3½ years (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/18.23?span=18.23-21.15"},"Acts 18:23–21:15"],"). On his return to Jerusalem he was arrested and sent to Caesarea (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/21.17?span=21.17-23.35"},"Acts 21:17–23:35"],"), where he remained a prisoner for two years (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/24.1?span=24.1-26.32"},"Acts 24:1–26:32"],"), and was then sent for trial to Rome, suffering shipwreck on the way (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/27.1?span=27.1-28.10"},"Acts 27:1–28:10"],"). He remained in Rome two years (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/28.30"},"Acts 28:30"],") and was then released. He then appears to have visited Asia, Macedonia, Crete, and perhaps Spain. At the end of about four years he was again taken a prisoner to Rome and suffered martyrdom, probably in the spring of",["span.small","A.D."],"65.
