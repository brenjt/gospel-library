Before that time gold and silver were used as a medium of exchange, but payments were made by weight. Hence the temptation arose to use false weights and false balances. Before the Exile sums of money were usually reckoned in shekels or talents. By a shekel we must always understand a shekel of silver, unless it is expressly stated to be of gold. In the Maccabean period the weight of a shekel was 218 grains (15.126 grams); in earlier times it may have been lighter."],["div",{"id":"p2","uri":"/scriptures/bd/money.p2","order":".000.2279"},"The only coin, properly so called, mentioned in the Old Testament is the gold",["span.translit",["span.emphasis","dram,"]],"bearing the figure of a crowned king who is kneeling and is holding in his right hand a spear and in his left a bow."],["div",{"id":"p3","uri":"/scriptures/bd/money.p3","order":".000.2280"},"Simon Maccabaeus coined silver shekels and half-shekels, as well as bronze money.
