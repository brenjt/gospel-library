But there is ample proof that He claimed to be the Son of God in a sense that was true of Him and of no one else (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/11.27"},"Matt. 11:27"],"[",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/10.22"},"Luke 10:22"],"];",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/13.32"},"Mark 13:32"],"). He speaks of Himself as Son of God, and of others as sons of God, but there is not a single passage in which the sonship of others is spoken of as being the same thing as His own. So too He speaks of “my Father” and “your Father,” but never of “our Father.” (The Lord’s Prayer is no exception, as it was intended for the disciples’ use.) There is a consistency in scripture, ancient and modern, that Jesus Christ is literally the Son of God the Father, being the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh.
