It passes through the Huleh Valley (the waters of Merom), then descends to the Sea of Galilee, 682 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. Passing out at the southern end of the lake, the river makes its way through a deep and intensely hot valley, 66 miles in length, called the Arabah, and finally enters the Dead or Salt Sea, 1292 feet below sea level. The total length of the river is well over 100 miles.
