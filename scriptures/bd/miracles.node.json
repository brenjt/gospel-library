Christianity is founded on the greatest of all miracles, the Resurrection of our Lord. If that be admitted, other miracles cease to be improbable. Miracles should not be regarded as deviations from the ordinary course of nature so much as manifestations of divine or spiritual power. Some lower law was in each case superseded by the action of a higher. They were intended to be a proof to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/11.4-5"},"Matt. 11:4–5"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/2.11"},"John 2:11"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/10.25"},"10:25"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/20.30-31"},"20:30–31"],"). Many of them were also symbolic, teaching such divine truths as the result of sin and the cure of sin; the value of faith; the curse of impurity; and the law of love. The miracles of healing also show how the law of love is to deal with the actual facts of life. Miracles were and are a response to faith and its best encouragement. They were never wrought without prayer, felt need, and faith."],["div",{"id":"p2","uri":"/scriptures/bd/miracles.p2","order":".000.2249"},"It is important to notice the different names by which miracles are described. They are called signs, as being visible tokens of an invisible power; they are powers or mighty works, because they are the acts of One who is almighty; they are simply works, or the natural results of the Messiah’s presence among men; they are wonders, marvels, because of the effect produced on those who saw them.
