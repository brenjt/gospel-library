During the period that the book covers, the Israelites formed a confederation of tribes rather than a compact nation. The tribes were united by their recognition of a common descent and still more by their common worship of Jehovah; but, except when the approach of a formidable enemy compelled them to act together, their unity seldom found practical expression and was often overborne by local jealousies. It was only in time of war that a single leader became indispensable and was invested by general consent with something of kingly authority. At the beginning of this period the Ark seems to have been at Bethel, while at its close it was at Shiloh (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-sam/4.3"},"1 Sam. 4:3"],"), but it is only mentioned expressly in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/judg/20.27"},"Judg. 20:27"],". The worship of Jehovah was in no way restricted to the precincts of the sanctuary of the Ark. There were various local sanctuaries, sometimes in private hands, as in the case of Micah, sometimes common to a whole family or community, as in the case of Ophrah. Their furniture consisted of a sacred pillar (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/judg/9.6"},"9:6"],") and an ephod or some sacred image (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/judg/8.27"},"8:27"],"). Much importance was attached to the presence of a duly qualified priest, familiar with the traditions of the priestly order (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/judg/17.9-10"},"17:9–10"],"). The lack of unity is vividly called to the reader’s attention in the closing sentence of the book (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/judg/21.25"},"Judg. 21:25"],"): “In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.”"]]],"refs":null}
