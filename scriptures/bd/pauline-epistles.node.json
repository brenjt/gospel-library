Many still looked upon the Church as a subdivision or an outgrowth of Judaism, and they saw no need to discontinue the ordinances of the law of Moses when they became members of the Christian Church. To them Christianity was something new, while the law was undoubtedly of divine appointment and approved by the example of generations of faithful Israelites. In the controversy Paul took a leading part, and in these four epistles he points men to the cross of Christ as the only source of eternal life (compare",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/12.27?span=12.27-16.15"},"Mosiah 12:27–16:15"],").
