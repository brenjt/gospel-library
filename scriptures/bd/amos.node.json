His emphasis was upon the moral character of Jehovah, the righteous ruler of all nations and men. Amos shows that the offering the Lord most cares for is a righteous life—the sacrifices of animals lose their meaning if offered as substitutes for personal righteousness (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/amos/5.21-27"},"5:21–27"],").
