The “fear of the Lord” is frequently spoken of as part of man’s duty (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/ps/111.10"},"Ps. 111:10"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/eccl/12.13"},"Eccl. 12:13"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/isa/11.2-3"},"Isa. 11:2–3"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/1.50"},"Luke 1:50"],"); it is also described as “godly fear” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/heb/12.28"},"Heb. 12:28"],"). In such passages fear is equivalent to reverence, awe, worship, and is therefore an essential part of the attitude of mind in which we ought to stand toward the All-holy God. On the other hand fear is spoken of as something unworthy of a child of God, something that “perfect love casteth out” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/1-jn/4.18"},"1 Jn. 4:18"],"). The first effect of Adam’s sin was that he was afraid (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/gen/3.10"},"Gen. 3:10"],"). Sin destroys that feeling of confidence God’s child should feel in a loving Father and produces instead a feeling of shame and guilt. Ever since the Fall God has been teaching men not to fear, but with penitence to ask forgiveness in full confidence of receiving it."]]],"refs":null}
