The pad for the stone was made of woven material or leather. One of the thongs would often be fitted with loops in which to insert one’s fingers. With a stone placed in the pad the sling would be swung around the head. When one of the strings was let go, the stone would fly out of its place to its mark. With practice, a person could become very accurate in casting stones in this manner. Flint slingstones have been found measuring three inches in diameter.
