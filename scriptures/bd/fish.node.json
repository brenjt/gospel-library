The Jews of Old Testament times do not seem to have paid much attention to the fisheries, for biblical allusions are few, and no fish is mentioned by name at all. The Tyrians brought fish to Jerusalem for sale (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/neh/13.16"},"Neh. 13:16"],"), and Tyre and Sidon were Phoenician fishing ports. There was a fish market (gate) in Jerusalem (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-chr/33.14"},"2 Chr. 33:14"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/neh/3.3"},"Neh. 3:3"],"), the supply for which came chiefly from the Mediterranean coast. The fishing of the Sea of Galilee in the time of Christ was extensive and of commercial importance. It was chiefly done by means of a drag-net or seine, which is a large net, leaded and buoyed, carried out by boats, and then drawn in toward land in a large semicircle (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/13.47-50"},"Matt. 13:47–50"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/5.5-6"},"Luke 5:5–6"],").
