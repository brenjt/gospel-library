The furniture was generally simple, consisting of an ark containing the rolls of the law and other sacred writings, a reading desk, and seats for the worshippers. Its affairs were managed by the local council of elders, who decided who should be admitted and who should be excluded (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/6.22"},"Luke 6:22"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/9.22"},"John 9:22"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/12.42"},"12:42"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/16.2"},"16:2"],"). The most important official was the Ruler of the Synagogue (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/5.22"},"Mark 5:22"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/13.14"},"Luke 13:14"],"), who was generally a scribe, had care of the building, and superintended the various services. There was also an attendant who performed clerical duties (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/4.20"},"Luke 4:20"],"). The Sabbath morning service was the most important in the week and included a fixed lesson (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/num/15.37-41"},"Num. 15:37–41"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/deut/6.4-9"},"Deut. 6:4–9"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/deut/11.13-21"},"11:13–21"],") and two lessons for the day, one from the law and the other from the prophets. A sermon was generally preached in explanation of one of the lessons (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/4.17"},"Luke 4:17"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/13.15"},"Acts 13:15"],"). The existence of synagogues in every town in which Jews were living, both in Palestine and elsewhere, was a great help to the spread of the gospel, early Christian missionaries being generally able to get a hearing there (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/13.5,14"},"Acts 13:5, 14"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/14.1"},"14:1"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/17.1,10"},"17:1, 10"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/18.4"},"18:4"],"), and the synagogue worship provided in many respects a model for early Christian worship."]]],"refs":null}
