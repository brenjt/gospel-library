One result of this dispersion was the existence in many different parts of the world of Jewish synagogues, which became of great service to the spread of Christianity (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/2.5-11"},"Acts 2:5–11"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/6.9"},"6:9"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/13.43-45"},"13:43–45"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/14.1-2,19"},"14:1–2, 19"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/16.3"},"16:3"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/17.1,10-13"},"17:1, 10–13"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/18.2,12,19"},"18:2, 12, 19"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/19.13-17,33"},"19:13–17, 33"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/28.17-29"},"28:17–29"],").

For their use, the Greek translation of the Old Testament known as the Septuagint was made.
