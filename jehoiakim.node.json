Jehoiakim was son of Joash, king of Judah, and brother of Zedekiah. He was not a faithful ruler; an interesting event is told of him burning the manuscript of one of the prophecies of Jeremiah (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/jer/36.1-26"},"Jer. 36:1–26"],"), whereupon Jeremiah wrote the prophecy again. Jehoiakim was given a dishonorable burial of an ass (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/jer/22.18-19"},"Jer. 22:18–19"],"). He was succeeded by his son Jehoiachin, who in turn was succeeded by Zedekiah. See",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bible-chron"},"Bible Chronology"],"in the appendix."]]],"refs":null}
