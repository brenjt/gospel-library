Anciently people were commanded to worship the Lord by offering their choicest animals as a sacrifice, in similitude of the Savior’s yet-future sacrifice. As part of his gospel, the Savior instituted a different sacrifice—the sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit, commemorated at the sacrament table. And in this dispensation, the Lord has added to the law of sacrifice and gospel law, revealing the law of consecration. When we receive the law of consecration, we covenant to give our time, our talents, and our possessions as needed for his work, and to offer ourselves—our hearts filled with gratitude, love, and humility."]],[".topic",["h2","IDEAS FOR LESSONS"],[".topic",["h3","Lesson 1: We Are Blessed As We Sacrifice"],["div",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/family-home-evening-resource-book/lesson-ideas/sacrifice.p7"},"Briefly discuss the following experiences:"],["div",{"id":"p8","uri":"/manual/family-home-evening-resource-book/lesson-ideas/sacrifice.p8"},["span.emphasis","Experience One."],"When Gordon was a small boy, his father turned away from the Church and refused to have anything to do with it.
