With the eating of the “forbidden fruit,” Adam and Eve became mortal, sin entered, and death became a part of life. Adam became the “first flesh” upon the earth (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.7"},"Moses 3:7"],"), meaning that he and Eve were the first to become mortal. After Adam fell, the whole creation fell and became mortal.
