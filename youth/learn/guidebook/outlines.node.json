Learning outlines are not meant to prescribe what you will say and do as you teach. They are designed to help you learn the doctrine for yourself and prepare to engage the youth in powerful learning experiences. Tailor these experiences to their interests and needs. Consider ways you can inspire them to act for themselves in seeking, finding, and sharing answers to their own gospel questions."],["p.para","Each outline includes references and links to recent teachings from the living prophets and other Church leaders, especially those given in general conference and the general Young Women meeting.
