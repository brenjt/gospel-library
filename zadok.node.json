During the latter years of Saul’s reign there seems to have been a double high priesthood: Abiathar, who belonged to the family of Ithamar, officiating in David’s camp, and Zadok at Gibeon, where the tabernacle was standing.

He anointed Solomon (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/1.32-45"},"1:32–45"],"); and was finally put in the room of Abiathar.
