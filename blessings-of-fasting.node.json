But are you aware of all the blessings that come with keeping this commandment? Here are several to consider.

So how does fasting do this? Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has explained that as you fast, “through your spirit, you develop personal power over your body’s drives of hunger and thirst. Fasting gives you confidence to know that your spirit can master appetite. … Fasting fortifies discipline over appetite and helps to protect against later uncontrolled cravings and gnawing habits” (“Self-Mastery,”",["span.emphasis","Ensign,"],"Nov. 1985, 30–31)."]],[".topic",{"id":"t2","uri":"/new-era/2013/08/blessings-of-fasting.t2"},[".title","Healing and Miracles"],["p.para",{"id":"p9","uri":"/new-era/2013/08/blessings-of-fasting.p9"},"In the New Testament, the disciples of Jesus Christ unsuccessfully tried to cast a devil out of a boy.
