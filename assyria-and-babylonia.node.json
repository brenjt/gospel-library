Assyria, or Asshur, occupied the Tigris valley to the north of Babylonia. Its center lay on the left bank of the Tigris, where the great city of Nineveh stood, opposite Mosul. Babylon and Nineveh were long rivals, but they had a common civilization of which the southern alluvium was the original home. Their language was Semitic, but in the southern country the Semites seem to have been preceded by another race from whom they acquired many things in their culture and religion, and to whom the origin of their peculiar cuneiform system of writing is generally ascribed. In process of time Assyria became the stronger power and began to push forth beyond its original limits. In the latter part of the 12th century",["span.small","B.C."],"the great conqueror Tiglath-pileser Ⅰ crossed the Euphrates and penetrated as far as the Phoenician coast; but these conquests were not permanent, and a period of deep decline followed; the monuments are silent for more than a century, and when they speak again about the close of the 10th century we find Assyria engaged in reestablishing its lost sovereignty in Mesopotamia."],["div",{"id":"p3","uri":"/scriptures/bd/assyria-and-babylonia.p3","order":".000.378"},"The great conqueror Assurnazirpal (884–860) consolidated his kingdom throughout the country of the Two Rivers to the borders of Babylonia and took tribute from the western princes as far as Phoenicia, while his successor Shalmaneser Ⅲ made many wars beyond the Euphrates. In 854",["span.small","B.C."],"he defeated a great confederation of Syrian states with Damascus at its head, and in 842 he took tribute from Jehu, king of Israel, but no sustained attempt to incorporate Syria in the empire was made till the reign of Tiglath-pileser Ⅲ (745–727). In 738 he took tribute from Damascus and Samaria (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/15.19"},"2 Kgs. 15:19"],"); in 734 these powers revolted and the result of a fresh war was the destruction of Damascus, the depopulation of Gilead and Naphtali (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/15.29"},"2 Kgs. 15:29"],"), and the acceptance of Assyrian suzerainty by Judah. There was now no independent state between Assyria and Egypt, and Egypt had no power to check the progress of the victor. But when Tiglath-pileser died, the Ethiopian So or Sebech (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/17.4"},"2 Kgs. 17:4"],") had made himself lord of all Egypt and had begun to foment a revolt in which Syria was involved, together with Philistia and Samaria, and that occupied the whole reign of Shalmaneser Ⅴ (727–722) and the first years of his successor. The siege of Samaria, begun by Shalmaneser (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/17.3-6"},"2 Kgs. 17:3–6"],"), was concluded by Sargon (722–705), a valiant prince, who smote the Egyptians at Raphia (720) and maintained and extended his borders on all sides."],["div",{"id":"p4","uri":"/scriptures/bd/assyria-and-babylonia.p4","order":".000.379"},"There was again a rising of the Philistines in 711 (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/isa/20"},"Isa. 20"],"), but once more the Egyptians failed their friends in the time of need.

If the Egyptians had been active Assyria might have been ruined, but while they encouraged the rebels they were so slow to take the field that the new king, Sennacherib (705–681), had time to crush the rising in the east and then appeared in Palestine (701). Once more the center of the revolt lay in the Philistine country supported by Hezekiah of Judah; but the rebels could do nothing without Egypt, and the siege of Ekron was formed before an Egyptian army appeared on the scene and was defeated in a great battle at Eltekeh. All Palestine now lay at the feet of the Assyrian; one man alone, the prophet Isaiah, who had never ceased to warn the Judeans against the vanity of their reliance on Egypt, remained undaunted and encouraged Hezekiah not to surrender his stronghold. The prophet’s confidence was justified; a great disaster fell on Sennacherib’s host (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/19.35"},"2 Kgs. 19:35"],"), and he was obliged to return to Nineveh, leaving Judea humbled indeed but in possession of some measure of self-government."],["div",{"id":"p5","uri":"/scriptures/bd/assyria-and-babylonia.p5","order":".000.380"},"Sennacherib was assassinated in 681 (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/19.37"},"2 Kgs. 19:37"],"), and from this date the Bible has little to say of the Assyrians.

The latter lost Egypt but otherwise maintained the empire in outward strength till his death, about 626",["span.small","B.C."],"After this, the fall came swiftly. The Assyrians, powerful to destroy, never showed themselves able to build up a stable political structure. They ruled by terror, crushing their enemies by fire and sword or weakening them by wholesale deportations to other parts of their empire.
