I found myself in the Sacred Grove, alone. I knelt down to pray, asking Heavenly Father to provide me some manifestation or indication about what I truly already knew had occurred in that sacred place. I prayed with great sincerity, for a long time, in an attitude of reverence. And I did not receive any answer or any prompting from the Holy Ghost. Nothing came. Finally, I gave up and left disappointed, wondering, “What didn’t I do right? Why? What more was needed?” It seemed to me that with the surroundings, there could not be any better place to receive an answer to such a prayer."],["div",{"id":"p8","uri":"/liahona/2013/06/strong-impressions-of-the-spirit.p8"},"I learned from that experience that we cannot demand things from God. We cannot say, “You have to answer me in this way, right this moment.” It is up to Him to decide how and when and what He will communicate to us. Our responsibility is to always be in the right condition to receive the promptings or whisperings, the revelation, the inspiration of the Spirit. But He makes the decision of how and when."]],["div",{"id":"f1","uri":"/liahona/2013/06/strong-impressions-of-the-spirit.f1"},[".credit",["div",{"id":"p20","uri":"/liahona/2013/06/strong-impressions-of-the-spirit.p20"},"Illustrations by Dan Burr"]]],["div",{"id":"t2","uri":"/liahona/2013/06/strong-impressions-of-the-spirit.t2"},[".title","Receiving an Answer at Home"],["div",{"id":"p10","uri":"/liahona/2013/06/strong-impressions-of-the-spirit.p10"},"What I was seeking at that time—which did not come then—did indeed come to me five or six weeks later. I was at home reading the Book of Mormon. And without my asking, there came upon me a strong impression, feeling, and communication through the Holy Ghost that confirmed my belief and testimony."],["div",{"id":"p11","uri":"/liahona/2013/06/strong-impressions-of-the-spirit.p11"},"It was such a strong communication that it made me cry. It was also such a pure communication that it had no need for words. The Spirit does not need to be limited to words; He can communicate Spirit to spirit with a language that is unmistakable because it has no words. It is a communication of pure knowledge and intelligence from the Spirit, and I have come to know that it truly is the best way to acquire knowledge. It is stronger and longer lasting than touching or seeing; we can come to doubt the physical senses, but we cannot doubt when the Holy Spirit speaks to us. It is the surest witness. Because of this, the unforgivable sin is to deny the Holy Ghost or the testimony of the Holy Ghost."]],["div",{"id":"t3","uri":"/liahona/2013/06/strong-impressions-of-the-spirit.t3"},[".title","Feeling God’s Love and Understanding"],["div",{"id":"p13","uri":"/liahona/2013/06/strong-impressions-of-the-spirit.p13"},"I truly feel fine that the Lord did not give me an answer in the Sacred Grove because I might have come to think that one must make a pilgrimage to Palmyra in order to be able to receive a testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Now I know that it can come at any place. You don’t have to go to Jerusalem in order to receive a testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. That testimony can come to any ordinary person, wherever he or she may be, because our Heavenly Father and the Holy Ghost know each one of us intimately. They know where we are and how to find us. And They don’t need visas. In fact, They are acquainted with the entire world!
