A discourse by the Lord to His disciples who were about to be sent forth on missions. It should be placed chronologically soon after the calling of the Twelve. It is similar in many respects to a sermon recorded in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/6.20-49"},"Luke 6:20–49"],", although the Matthew account contains more pointed references to the law, the prophets, and the individual calling and responsibility of the disciples. The Luke account appears to have a more general application. For example, “Ye are the salt of the earth” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/5.13"},"Matt. 5:13"],"); “Ye are the light of the world” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/5.14"},"Matt. 5:14"],"); and, “take no thought, saying, What shall we eat … drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/6.31"},"Matt. 6:31"],") do not occur in the Luke account.
