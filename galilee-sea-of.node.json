It lies 680 feet below sea-level; the heat is very great, and the cold air rushing down from the hills often produces sudden storms (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/8.22-24"},"Luke 8:22–24"],"). The river Jordan flows right through it, from north to south. In the Lord’s time there were nine cities on the shore of the lake, including Capernaum, Bethsaida, and Gergesa, each with a population of over 15,000. The lake and its shores were crowded with busy workers. The best fishing ground was at the north end, and a large quantity of pickled fish was exported to all parts of the Roman Empire."]]],"refs":null}
