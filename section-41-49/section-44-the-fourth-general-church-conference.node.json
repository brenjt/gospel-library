He was a man of large benevolence, and his sympathies were quickly aroused by any tale of sorrow or appeal for relief. In the most busy and trying periods of his life those who went to him for counsel in their troubles, always found him willing to listen, and they were sure to receive encouragement and assistance. To extend comfort to the bruised spirit, and to help the needy and distressed appeared a constant pleasure to him. His hospitality, also, was a marked feature in his character. His house was always open to entertain the stranger. One of the most cherished recollections of many of the old members of the church is the kindness with which they were treated by ‘Brother Joseph,’ and the warm welcome he gave them to his house upon their arrival at Kirtland and other places where he lived.” (",["span.emphasis","Life of Joseph Smith,"],"pp. 109–10.)"]]]]],"refs":null}
