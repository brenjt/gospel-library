Before the Nephites were destroyed, Moroni served among them as a military leader and a Church leader (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/6.12"},"Mormon 6:12"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.1"},"Moroni 8:1"],"). Like other major writers and compilers of the Book of Mormon, Moroni was a witness of the Savior. He testified, “I have seen Jesus, and … he hath talked with me face to face” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.39"},"Ether 12:39"],"). Moroni was faithful to his testimony, refusing to deny Christ during a time when the Lamanites were killing every Nephite who would not deny Him (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/moro/1.1-3"},"Moroni 1:1–3"],"). In 1823, approximately 1,400 years after completing the record of the Book of Mormon, Moroni appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith as a resurrected being and informed Joseph that the record was deposited in a hill near his home (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.29-35"},"Joseph Smith—History 1:29–35"],"). At that time and periodically during the next four years, Moroni instructed Joseph Smith “respecting what the Lord was going to do, and how and in what manner his kingdom was to be conducted in the last days” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.54"},"Joseph Smith—History 1:54"],")."]],[".topic",{"id":"t3","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/moroni/moroni.t3"},["h2","To whom was this book written and why?"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/moroni/moroni.p7"},"Moroni stated, “I write a few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth unto my brethren, the Lamanites, in some future day” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/moro/1.4"},"Moroni 1:4"],"; see also",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.1"},"Moroni 10:1"],"). He also declared that he spoke “unto all the ends of the earth,” warning that at the judgment bar of God, all would be held accountable for the words he had written (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.24,27"},"Moroni 10:24, 27"],").

It also includes Mormon’s description of the depravity of the Nephites and Lamanites before their final battle at Cumorah (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/moro/9"},"Moroni 9"],"). Moroni included his own teachings on gifts of the Spirit (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.8-26"},"Moroni 10:8–26"],"). He also recorded an invitation, found in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5"},"Moroni 10:3–5"],", that provides a key contribution to the Book of Mormon. Referring to this passage, President Gordon B.
