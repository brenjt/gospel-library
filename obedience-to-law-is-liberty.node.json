My niece gave it to me. It had been among the things I had left in our old family home when I moved out after I was married. The gift was this little brown book I hold in my hand. It is a book that was given to LDS servicemen who entered the armed forces during World War II. I personally viewed the book as a gift from President Heber J.

Our next best course is to put in your hands such portions of modern revelation and of explanations of the principles of the Gospel as shall bring to you, wherever you may be, renewed hope and faith, as likewise comfort, consolation, and peace of spirit.”",["sup",["a",{"href":"fn_1"},"1"]]],["div",{"id":"p7","uri":"/general-conference/2013/04/obedience-to-law-is-liberty.p7"},"Today we find ourselves in another war. This is not a war of armaments. It is a war of thoughts, words, and deeds. It is a war with sin, and more than ever we need to be reminded of the commandments.

We recognize that when God the Eternal Father presented His plan to us at the beginning of time, Satan wanted to alter the plan. He said he would redeem all mankind. Not one soul would be lost, and Satan was confident he could deliver on his proposal. But there was an unacceptable cost—the destruction of man’s agency, which was and is a gift given by God (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.1-3"},"Moses 4:1–3"],"). About this gift, President Harold B. Lee said, “Next to life itself, free agency is God’s greatest gift to mankind.”",["sup",["a",{"href":"fn_3"},"3"]],"Then it was no small thing for Satan to disregard man’s agency.

His backup plan—the plan he has been executing since the time of Adam and Eve—was to tempt men and women, essentially to prove we are undeserving of the God-given gift of agency. Satan has many reasons for doing what he does. Perhaps the most powerful is the motive of revenge, but he also wants to make men and women miserable like he is miserable. None of us should ever underestimate how driven Satan is to succeed. His role in God’s eternal plan creates “opposition in all things” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11"},"2 Nephi 2:11"],") and tests our agency.
