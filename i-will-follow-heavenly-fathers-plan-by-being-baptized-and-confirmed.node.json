They wanted to hear Alma teach about the gospel of Jesus Christ. After Alma taught them for many days, he asked them if they wanted to make a covenant to serve God and keep His commandments. He told them that if they would be baptized, the Holy Ghost would always be with them (see",["a",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.7-10"},"Mosiah 18:7–10"],")."],["div",{"id":"p5","uri":"/liahona/2013/06/i-will-follow-heavenly-fathers-plan-by-being-baptized-and-confirmed.p5"},"When they heard this, the people were so happy that they “clapped their hands for joy” (",["a",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.11"},"Mosiah 18:11"],"). Alma baptized about 200 people in the Waters of Mormon.

Like those people, when we are baptized, we make a covenant with God. We promise to keep His commandments and serve Him. We take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and become members of His Church.
