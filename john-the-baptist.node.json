At the time of the baptism of Jesus, John saw the sign and heard the voice of the Father bearing record that Jesus was the Beloved Son, in whom the Father was well pleased (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/3.13-17"},"Matt. 3:13–17"],").

This greatness consisted of his unique privileges and the quality of his work. He alone was entrusted with the mission of preparing the way and baptizing the Savior of the world.

Latter-day revelation confirms the biblical account and also makes known additional events in the ministry of John.
