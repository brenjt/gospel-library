Through His Church, the Lord has provided a way for us to care for those in need. He has asked us to give generously according to what we have received from Him. “The Lord’s way of caring for the needy is different from the world’s way. The Lord has said, ‘[Caring for the poor] must needs be done in mine own way.’ [",["a",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104.16"},"Doctrine and Covenants 104:16"],"; see also verse",["a",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104.15"},"15"],".] He is not only interested in our immediate needs; He is also concerned about our eternal progression.
