Could that be possible? “One soul shall not be lost,” he boasted; then he added the condition for such a feat. “Surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.” (See",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.1"},"Moses 4:1"],".)"],["p.para",{"id":"p41","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-1-the-great-jehovah-comes-to-earth/chapter-2-the-promised-messiah.p41"},"What my reaction was to such terrible audacity I cannot help but wonder.
