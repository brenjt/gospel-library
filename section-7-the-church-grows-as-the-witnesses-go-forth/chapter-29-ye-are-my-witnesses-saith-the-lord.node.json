Though little detail of those days is recorded, we can be certain that during that time the church and its leaders received much of the power that fired them with the will to accomplish what they did. Christ’s similar mission among the Nephites in the New World so completely affected their society that war, poverty, injustice, and contention—evils that have plagued mankind from the dawning of history—were banished for nearly two hundred years.

The lives of the former-day saints were transformed by that witness, and in turn they transformed the lives of thousands of others. The New Testament from Acts to Revelation contains the record of their efforts, the effect of those efforts upon the lives of those who were touched, and the adversary’s attempts to smother and impede the Lord’s work.

Nowhere do we get a better view of Paul’s travels in behalf of the kingdom of Christ. Further, the epistles written by Paul and others take on their greatest significance only when viewed against the backdrop of the narrative provided by Luke. We see the infant church and its leaders struggling with the problems encountered when the new revelation in Christ is thrust against the time-honored traditions of the Jews. Are gentiles who enter the church bound by the Mosaic restrictions? Do Jews who become Christians continue to be subject to the law of Moses?

Chapters one through seven deal with events in the city of Jerusalem only. Following the stoning of Stephen, however, the disciples “were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria.” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/8.1"},"Acts 8:1"],".) Luke informs us that those thus scattered “went every where preaching the word.” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/8.4"},"Acts 8:4"],".)

Clearly, the gospel message had moved out of Jerusalem.
