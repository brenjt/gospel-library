Pride, class distinctions, and persecutions then arose and led to great wickedness and the eventual overthrow of the Nephite government. The signs of Jesus Christ’s death in Jerusalem included great destructions that destroyed many Nephite cities, killing the wicked inhabitants. Darkness covered the land for three days. Amidst the darkness, the voice of the Savior invited the people to return to Him. When the darkness dispersed, the peoples’ mourning turned to joy and praise of Jesus Christ."]],[".topic",{"id":"t13","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/3-nephi/unit-24-day-3-3-nephi-6-10.t13"},["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6"},"3 Nephi 6–7"]],["h3","The Nephites become prideful, the Church is broken up, secret combinations destroy the government, and the people divide into tribes"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/3-nephi/unit-24-day-3-3-nephi-6-10.p7"},"Think about a time when you had to make a decision about whether or not you would follow the prophet.
