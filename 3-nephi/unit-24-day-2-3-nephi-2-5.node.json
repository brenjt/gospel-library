Many of the Nephites and Lamanites rejected further signs and wonders and increased in wickedness. As a result, the Gadianton robbers grew in strength and threatened to destroy the Nephites. The Nephites’ chief judge, Lachoneus, gathered all the righteous Nephites and Lamanites together and called on the people to repent and prepare for battle. Because of their unity and faith in the Lord, they triumphed over their enemies. Following their deliverance, the righteous Nephites and Lamanites acknowledged the power of God in their preservation."]],[".topic",{"id":"t8","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/3-nephi/unit-24-day-2-3-nephi-2-5.t8"},["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2"},"3 Nephi 2"]],["h3","The righteous Nephites and Lamanites unite to defend themselves against the Gadianton robbers"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/3-nephi/unit-24-day-2-3-nephi-2-5.p7"},"Think about a few significant spiritual experiences you have had in your life.
