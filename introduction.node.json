One of the thrills of gospel teaching is to have a student come, sometimes after much time has elapsed, and say, “I was fasting and praying for an answer, and what you said was the answer to my prayers.” The imparting of special inspiration in answer to an individual’s unspoken needs is not the only function of the Spirit.
