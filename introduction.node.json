It is an evil alluded to by the Savior when he warned: “But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/18.6"},"Matthew 18:6"],")."],["div",{"id":"p3","uri":"/manual/preventing-and-responding-to-child-abuse-helps-for-members/introduction.p3"},"Child abuse can take many forms. Some abuse may be inadvertent or unknowing. Some is intentional, vicious, and predatory. Even older children can be victims. All child abuse is wrong. It harms families. In any form it is tragic and in opposition to the teachings of the Savior."],["div",{"id":"p4","uri":"/manual/preventing-and-responding-to-child-abuse-helps-for-members/introduction.p4"},"Family members can help stop abuse and protect and get help for those who have been injured. Members who have been abused need kind, caring attention from family members and others. They may also need professional assistance that is consistent with the teachings of the Savior. Those who have offended also need help. To keep the abuse secret often allows it to continue. Most repeat offenders have difficulty changing until they experience the full consequences of their actions. When family members or others are aware of abuse in the family, they should abide by local laws governing the reporting of abuse. They should also contact their bishop for counsel and assistance. A child who has been abused by a parent should discuss the matter with the nonabusing parent or another trusted adult and with the bishop."]]],"refs":null}
