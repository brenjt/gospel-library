His gospel (see",["i",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bd/gospels"},"Gospels"]],") was possibly written under the direction of Peter.

Energy and humility are the characteristics of his portrait. It is full of descriptive touches that help us to realize the impression made upon the bystanders. Tradition states that after Peter’s death, Mark visited Egypt, founded the Church of Alexandria, and died by martyrdom."]]],"refs":null}
