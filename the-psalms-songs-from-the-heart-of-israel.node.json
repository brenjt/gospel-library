It has been given to man so he can sing praises to the Lord. It is a means of expressing, with poetic words and in melodious tunes, the deep feelings of rejoicing and thanksgiving found in the hearts of those who have testimonies of the divine Sonship and who know of the wonders and glories wrought for them by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Music is both in the voice and in the heart. Every true saint finds his heart full of songs of praise to his Maker. Those whose voices can sing forth the praises found in their hearts are twice blest. ‘Be filled with the Spirit,’ Paul counseled, ‘Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.’ (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/eph/5.18-19"},"Eph. 5:18–19"],".)

Lucifer uses much that goes by the name of music to lead people to that which does not edify and is not of God.

Of that music which meets the divine standard and has the Lord’s approval, he says: ‘My soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.’ (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.12"},"D&C 25:12"],".)"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/old-testament-student-manual-genesis-2-samuel/the-psalms-songs-from-the-heart-of-israel.p7"},"“In view of all that the Lord Jesus Christ has done for us, ought we not to sing praises to his holy name forever?” (McConkie, The Promised Messiah, p. 553.)"],["p.para",{"id":"p8","uri":"/manual/old-testament-student-manual-genesis-2-samuel/the-psalms-songs-from-the-heart-of-israel.p8"},"The psalms in Hebrew are called",["span.emphasis","Tehillim,"],"a word coming from the Hebrew word",["span.emphasis","halal,"],"“to praise” (Clarke, Bible Commentary, 3:199).

This position, despite the contention of negative criticism, is indicated by the following reasons: (1) David’s name is famous in the O. T. period for music and song and is closely associated with holy liturgy (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-sam/6.5-15"},"II Sam. 6:5–15"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-chr/16.4"},"I Chron. 16:4"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-chr/7.6"},"II Chron. 7:6"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-chr/29.30"},"29:30"],"). (2) David was especially endowed by the Holy Spirit (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-sam/23.1,2"},"I Sam. 23:1, 2"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/12.36"},"Mark 12:36"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/2.25-31"},"Acts 2:25–31"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/4.25,26"},"4:25, 26"],"). (3) David’s music and poetical gifts appear indelibly interwoven on the pages of O. T. history. He is called ‘the sweet psalmist of Israel’ (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-sam/23.1"},"II Sam. 23:1"],"). He was a skilled performer on the lyre (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.16-18"},"I Sam. 16:16–18"],"). He was the author of the masterful elegy written upon the death of Saul and Jonathan (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-sam/1.19-27"},"II Sam. 1:19–27"],"). He is referred to as a model poet-musician by the prophet Amos (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/amos/6.5"},"Amos 6:5"],"). (4) Much internal evidence in the psalms themselves point to David’s authorship. Most of the songs attributed to him reflect some period of his life, such as Psa. 23, 51 and 57. In line with this evidence of Scripture, a number of the psalms indicate Davidic authorship.

John’s account of this same occurrence ties the act at the crucifixion in with David’s prediction by recounting: ‘Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.’ It is as though advisedly and with deliberation, though he was in agony beyond compare, yet he consciously continued to the last moment of mortal life, with the avowed purpose of fulfilling all of the Messianic utterances concerning his mortal Messiahship. ‘Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar,’ John’s account continues, ‘and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.’ (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/19.28-30"},"John 19:28–30"],".)"],["p.para",{"id":"p95","uri":"/manual/old-testament-student-manual-genesis-2-samuel/the-psalms-songs-from-the-heart-of-israel.p95"},"“Viewing in advance, as it were, this last awesome moment of the Messiah’s mortal life, David wrote: ‘Into thine hand I commit my spirit.’ (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/ps/31.5"},"Ps. 31:5"],".)
