Now you are a member of an additional family, a mortal family. Because of Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation, it is possible for you to become like Him. It is also possible to secure your mortal family in an eternal bond, allowing you to be together as a family after death. This chapter focuses on the importance of individuals and families and their potential in the plan of salvation. As you study this chapter, you will gain a deeper understanding of the eternal significance of the family and its role in Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation. This knowledge will help you lay the foundation for doing family history work and resist worldly efforts to minimize the importance of the family and to disregard individual worth."]],[".topic",{"id":"t2","uri":"/manual/introduction-to-family-history-student-manual/chapter-1.t2"},["h2","Commentary"],[".topic",{"id":"t3","uri":"/manual/introduction-to-family-history-student-manual/chapter-1.t3"},["h3","“The Worth of Souls Is Great in the Sight of God”",["span.dominant","[1.1]"]],[".box-decor",{"id":"f1","uri":"/manual/introduction-to-family-history-student-manual/chapter-1.f1"},["h4","Scriptures to Study and Ponder"],["ul.bullet",["li",["span.label","•"],["p.para",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/10.29-31"},"Matthew 10:29–31"]]],["li",["span.label","•"],["p.para",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33"},"2 Nephi 26:33"]]],["li",["span.label","•"],["p.para",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.10-16"},"Doctrine and Covenants 18:10–16"]]],["li",["span.label","•"],["p.para",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39"},"Moses 1:39"]]]]],[".image",{"id":"f3","uri":"/manual/introduction-to-family-history-student-manual/chapter-1.f3"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/09559/christ-in-gethsemane_1083555.jpg"}],[".caption",["p",{"id":"lds-"},"The Atonement of Jesus Christ helps us understand our worth in the sight of God."]]],[".topic",{"id":"t4","uri":"/manual/introduction-to-family-history-student-manual/chapter-1.t4"},["h4","The Atonement of Jesus Christ helps us understand our worth in the sight of God.",["span.dominant","[1.1.1]"]],["p.para",{"id":"p14","uri":"/manual/introduction-to-family-history-student-manual/chapter-1.p14"},["b","Elder M. Russell Ballard"],"of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught how the worth of each person is best understood through the Atonement of Jesus Christ:"],["p.para",{"id":"p15","uri":"/manual/introduction-to-family-history-student-manual/chapter-1.p15"},"“I believe that if we could truly understand the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ, we would realize how precious is",["span.emphasis","one"],"son or daughter of God.
