In the Old Testament we read that the Babylonians conquered the kingdom of Judah, taking many Israelites captive to Babylon. The city of Babylon was very large and the people of the city were very wealthy, displaying their riches with fancy buildings, clothing, and leisure activities. They also worshiped idols. Because of the worldliness of Babylon, and because it was a place where the children of Israel were captive, the Lord often used the name Babylon in the scriptures to represent sin, worldliness, the influence of the devil on the earth, and the spiritual captivity that comes from these things (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.16"},"D&C 1:16"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.5,7,14"},"133:5, 7, 14"],").
