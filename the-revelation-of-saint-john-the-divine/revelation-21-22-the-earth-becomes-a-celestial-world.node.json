Those things were but for a moment, and we are now here. We have been faithful during a few moments in our mortality, and now we enjoy eternal life and glory, with power to progress in all the boundless knowledge and through the countless stages of progression, enjoying the smiles and approbation [favor] of our Father and God, and of Jesus Christ’” (in Journal of Discourses, 7:275)."]],[".bodyBlock",[".topic",["h2","Understanding the Scriptures"],[".figure",{"id":"f56","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-revelation-of-saint-john-the-divine/revelation-21-22-the-earth-becomes-a-celestial-world.f56"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/rev/21"},"Revelation 21"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","Adorned"],"(v. 2)"],["td","Made beautiful, dressed up"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Tabernacle"],"(v. 3)"],["td","Dwelling place"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Foursquare"],"(v. 16)"],["td","In the shape of a square"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Defileth"],"(v. 27)"],["td","To make unclean or unholy"],["td"]]]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/rev/21.2"},"Revelation 21:2"],"—New Jerusalem"],["p.para",{"id":"p295","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-revelation-of-saint-john-the-divine/revelation-21-22-the-earth-becomes-a-celestial-world.p295"},"The New Jerusalem spoken of in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/rev/21"},"Revelation 21"],"is not the same city that is to be built on the American continent as part of the last days and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.10"},"Articles of Faith 1:10"],").
