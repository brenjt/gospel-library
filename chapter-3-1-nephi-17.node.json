Occasionally young people have a difficult time seeing how they are led by the Lord. Often they expect Him to remove obstacles or eliminate opposition. But as Nephi explained, it is more likely that the Lord will lead them by nourishing them, strengthening them, and providing means for them to overcome obstacles and meet opposition as they strive to keep His commandments (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.3"},"1 Nephi 17:3"],")."]],[".topic",["h3","Scripture Activity"],["div",{"id":"p3","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-video-guide/chapter-3-1-nephi-17.p3"},"If the Lord’s children keep His commandments, the Lord “doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.3"},"1 Nephi 17:3"],"). Help the class recall examples of how the Lord led Lehi and his group. Possible illustrations include Nephi and his brothers going back for the brass plates, enlisting Ishmael and his household, the Lord’s freeing Nephi from his brothers, Lehi’s vision of the tree of life, Nephi’s vision, and their experiences in the wilderness, including the broken bow incident.
