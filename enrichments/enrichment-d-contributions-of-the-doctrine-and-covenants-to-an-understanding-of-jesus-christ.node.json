One of the most comforting things derived from faith in the Savior is the knowledge that at some time everything will be made right, that justice will be done. There is something inherent in virtually every person that cries out for the righting of wrongs, the squaring of accounts, the giving of just dues, whether those dues be blessings for obedience or punishments for disobedience. In numerous instances in the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord bears witness that He is a just God and that all people will be brought to judgment, receiving blessings for obedience and punishments for all transgressions not repented of (see, for example,",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.4"},"D&C 3:4"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.28"},"10:28"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/39.16-18"},"39:16–18"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.4"},"82:4"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.102"},"84:102"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.84"},"107:84"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.77"},"109:77"],")."],["div",{"id":"p281","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/enrichments/enrichment-d-contributions-of-the-doctrine-and-covenants-to-an-understanding-of-jesus-christ.p281"},["span.emphasis","The mercy of Christ"],".
