Matthew (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/6.9-13"},"6:9–13"],") includes it in the Sermon on the Mount, while Luke (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/11.1-5"},"11:1–5"],") tells us that it was given by our Lord in answer to a request from one of His disciples. There are some small differences in the form in which the two disciples have recorded the prayer; these may be accounted for by supposing that they themselves did not always use exactly the same words in saying the prayer. A slightly different rendition is found in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/13.9-13"},"3 Ne. 13:9–13"],"; and further variations are to be seen in",["span.small","JST"],"Matt. 6:9–15 (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/6.13a"},"Matt. 6:13 note",["i","a"]],")."]]],"refs":null}
