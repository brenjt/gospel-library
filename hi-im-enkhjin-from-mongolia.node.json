One of my classmates is not a member of the Church, but I taught her about the Word of Wisdom and told her to drink milk instead of coffee or tea. I also taught her how to pray to Heavenly Father, since she didn’t know. I also invited her to family home evening at my house."]]],[".resources",[".moreInfo",[".title","Enkhjin’s favorites:"],["div",{"id":"p9","uri":"/friend/2013/06/hi-im-enkhjin-from-mongolia.p9"},"Foods—pizza and mashed potatoes"],["div",{"id":"p10","uri":"/friend/2013/06/hi-im-enkhjin-from-mongolia.p10"},"Scripture—",["a",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7"},"1 Nephi 3:7"]],["div",{"id":"p11","uri":"/friend/2013/06/hi-im-enkhjin-from-mongolia.p11"},"Songs—“Away in a Manger,” “Book of Mormon Stories”"]],[".moreInfo",["div",{"id":"p12","uri":"/friend/2013/06/hi-im-enkhjin-from-mongolia.p12"},"Meet more kids like Enkhjin by clicking “One in a Million” at",["a",{"href":"http://lds.org/friend"},"lds.org/friend"],"."]]]],"refs":null}
