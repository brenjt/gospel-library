W. W. Phelps and other prominent Saints apostatized during this period of persecution. W. W. Phelps was later excommunicated. Through the winter of 1838–39 the Prophet Joseph and other leaders languished in jail while the Saints were driven from the state. Some time after, the Prophet and his companions were set free, W. W. Phelps wrote a letter asking for Joseph’s forgiveness and to be accepted back into the Church (see History of the Church, 4:142). Considering all that he had gone through, the Prophet’s response could have been venomous. Read the letter Joseph Smith wrote to W. W. Phelps (see History of the Church, 4:163–64). The poem at the end of the letter greatly touched Brother Phelps."],[".para","W. W. Phelps was a firm and loyal friend of the Prophet from that day forward. Following the Martyrdom, Brother Phelps spoke at the Prophet’s funeral, where he read one last poem to his good friend: “Praise to the Man” (see Hymns,",["span.crossRef","no. 27"],"). Every time we sing this hymn, or any of the hymns Brother Phelps wrote, we might remember the lesson on forgiving others that the Prophet exemplified so beautifully in his relationship with W. W.
