Paradise is that part of the spirit world in which the righteous spirits who have departed from this life await the resurrection of the body. It is a condition of happiness and peace. However, the scriptures are not always consistent in the use of the word, especially in the Bible. For example, when Jesus purportedly said to the thief on the cross, “To day shalt thou be with me in paradise” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/23.43"},"Luke 23:43"],"), the Bible rendering is incorrect.
