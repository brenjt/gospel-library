Frankincense was put upon each row (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/24.7"},"Lev. 24:7"],"). The shewbread was changed every Sabbath day and the old loaves were eaten by the priests in a holy place (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/24.9"},"Lev. 24:9"],"). In the shewbread the 12 tribes were perpetually presented before God; yet it was wholly consumed by man; thus it provided both a sacrifice and a communion. On one occasion the shewbread was given to David to eat (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-sam/21.6"},"1 Sam. 21:6"],"); the Lord drew from this incident the lesson that the law of charity overrides every ritual law (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/12.4"},"Matt. 12:4"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/2.26"},"Mark 2:26"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/6.4"},"Luke 6:4"],")."]]],"refs":null}
