Let the children dance the way the music makes them feel. Have them one by one take a turn to dance for the family so that each gets a turn to have everyoneâ€™s complete attention. It is important that you allow them to be graceful, silly, or even clumsy as long as they are expressing something. If you are understanding, they will enjoy being inventive."],[".para","The children will want to dance only two or three minutes each turn. Vary the fun by grouping them now and then in different ways between solo acts. This is a simple activity, but one the children find extremely satisfying."],[".para","You may want to use some variations to their free expression by giving each a certain activity that he is to dance.

Have everyone form a circle around someone. The person in the middle is the statue maker. He has each one come to him in turn to be swung around two or three times and then released. The position in which the one being swung comes to rest must be kept until all have been swung. All this time the statue maker has in mind what he wants them to be.
