At first he had no desire to be baptized, even though his sister Eliza (the same Eliza R. Snow who wrote many Latter-day Saint hymns and served as the second general president of the Relief Society) had eagerly embraced the gospel. He did, however, find the Church’s doctrine very interesting. When Lorenzo began to attend college in Oberlin, Ohio, he would often share Church beliefs with the students who were training to become Protestant ministers. Although he hadn’t yet committed to be baptized, he presented the gospel so well that many of the students at Oberlin admitted the possible truth of the restored Church."],["div",{"id":"p13","uri":"/new-era/2013/01/getting-to-know-lorenzo-snow.p13"},"As strong a missionary as he was before he accepted the gospel, it’s no wonder that Lorenzo became even more dedicated to the work after he was baptized. During his early years as a member of the Church, he was called to serve several full-time missions. He first served in Ohio, followed by Missouri, Kentucky, and Illinois, USA. He was later sent to Great Britain to assist with the organization of the Church in England. While there, he even gave copies of the Book of Mormon to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. He later served missions in Italy, Switzerland, and what would eventually become known as the Hawaiian Islands."]],["div",{"id":"t2","uri":"/new-era/2013/01/getting-to-know-lorenzo-snow.t2"},[".title","Miracle at Sea"],["div",{"id":"p15","uri":"/new-era/2013/01/getting-to-know-lorenzo-snow.p15"},"When Elder Snow left England to return to Nauvoo, Illinois, he brought a large group of newly baptized members with him.
