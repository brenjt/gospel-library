Directly following these two oratorio numbers, in another recitative for tenor (no. 29), Handel uses as his text words of the sixty-ninth Psalm, pathos-filled words: “Thy rebuke hath broken His heart; He is full of heaviness, Thy rebuke hath broken His heart; He looked for some to have pity on Him, but there was no man, neither found He any to comfort Him.” (See",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/ps/69.20"},"Psalm 69:20"],".)"],["p.para",{"id":"p47","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-6-the-glorified-palestinian-ministry/chapter-27-he-is-risen.p47"},"After experiencing ridicule, an illegal hearing, and abuse at the hands of Herod and Pilate, Jesus was led away to be crucified at a place called Calvary, where those who passed by him reviled him by saying, “If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.” The chief priests mocked him, as did the scribes and the elders, by saying: “He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.” Even one of the thieves that was crucified with him “cast the same in his teeth.” Several hours later, in agony, he cried with a loud voice, asking why he had been forsaken by his Father; and not long thereafter, in relief, Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and he “yielded up the ghost.” It was finished. (See",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/27.35-50"},"Matthew 27:35–50"],".) The prophecies of the psalmist were fulfilled. Many that saw him had laughed him to scorn, and few had demonstrated pity in his behalf. “Reproach [had] broken [his] heart; and [he was] full of heaviness: and [he] looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but [he] found none.” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/ps/69.20"},"Psalm 69:20"],".

To say that this woman, chosen from among women as deserving of such distinctive honors, was once a fallen creature, her soul seared by the heat of unhallowed lust, is to contribute to the perpetuating of an error for which there is no excuse. Nevertheless the false tradition, arising from early and unjustifiable assumption, that this noble woman, distinctively a friend of the Lord, is the same who, admittedly a sinner, washed and anointed the Savior’s feet in the house of Simon the Pharisee and gained the boon of forgiveness through contrition, has so tenaciously held its place in the popular mind through the centuries, that the name, Magdalene, has come to be a generic designation for women who fall from virtue and afterward repent. We are not considering whether the mercy of Christ could have been extended to such a sinner as Mary of Magdala is wrongly reputed to have been; man cannot measure the bounds nor fathom the depths of divine forgiveness; and if it were so that this Mary and the repentant sinner who ministered to Jesus as He sat at the Pharisee’s table were one and the same, the question would stand affirmatively answered, for that woman who had been a sinner was forgiven.

Though the resurrected Christ manifested the same friendly and intimate regard as He had shown in the mortal state toward those with whom He had been closely associated, He was no longer one of them in the literal sense. There was about Him a divine dignity that forbade close personal familiarity. To Mary Magdalene Christ had said: ‘Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father.’ If the second clause was spoken in explanation of the first, we have to infer that no human hand was to be permitted to touch the Lord’s resurrected and immortalized body until after He had presented Himself to the Father. It appears reasonable and probable that between Mary’s impulsive attempt to touch the Lord, and the action of the other women who held Him by the feet as they bowed in worshipful reverence, Christ did ascend to the Father, and that later He returned to earth to continue His ministry in the resurrected state.” (Talmage,",["span.emphasis","Jesus the Christ,"],"p. 682.)"]],[".topic",["h4","(27-7)",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/20.17"},"John 20:17"],".

There was neither precedent nor analogy for the stories these women told—of a dead person returning to life, with a body of flesh and bones, such as could be seen and felt—except the instances of the young man of Nain, the daughter of Jairus, and the beloved Lazarus of Bethany, between whose cases of restoration to a renewal of mortal life and the reported resurrection of Jesus they recognized essential differences.

The falsehood is its own refutation. Unbelievers of later date, recognizing the palpable absurdity of this gross attempt at misrepresentation, have not hesitated to suggest other hypotheses, each of which is conclusively untenable. Thus, the theory based upon the impossible assumption that Christ was not dead when taken from the cross, but was in a state of coma or swoon, and that He was afterward resuscitated, disproves itself when considered in connection with recorded facts. The spear-thrust of the Roman soldier would have been fatal, even if death had not already occurred. The body was taken down, handled, wrapped and buried by members of the Jewish council, who cannot be thought of as actors in the burial of a living man; and so far as subsequent resuscitation is concerned, Edersheim (vol. 2, p. 626) trenchantly remarks: ‘Not to speak of the many absurdities which this theory involves, it really shifts—if we acquit the disciples of complicity—the fraud upon Christ Himself.’ A crucified person, removed from the cross before death and subsequently revived, could not have walked with pierced and mangled feet on the very day of his resuscitation, as Jesus did on the road to Emmaus. Another theory that has had its day is that of unconscious deception on the part of those who claimed to have seen the resurrected Christ, such persons having been victims of subjective but unreal visions conjured up by their own excited and imaginative condition. The independence and marked individuality of the several recorded appearings of the Lord disprove the vision theory. Such subjective visual illusions as are predicated by this hypothesis, presuppose a state of expectancy on the part of those who think they see; but all the incidents connected with the manifestations of Jesus after His resurrection were directly opposed to the expectations of those who were made witnesses of His resurrected state."],["p.para",{"id":"p72","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-6-the-glorified-palestinian-ministry/chapter-27-he-is-risen.p72"},"“The foregoing instances of false and untenable theories regarding the resurrection of our Lord are cited as examples of the numerous abortive attempts to explain away the greatest miracle and the most glorious fact of history.
