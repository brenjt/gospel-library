Teachers must learn principles of effective teaching and master effective teaching skills line upon line through study, faith, practice, and experience. There are many ways to evaluate teaching effectiveness and to receive feedback and assistance as to how to improve. Some things that will help teachers improve are formal, structured methods such as observation and feedback from peers, supervisors, or students. There are also informal ways such as listening to students, watching other teachers, or sharing ideas and experiences with colleagues."],[".img-left",{"id":"f1","uri":"/manual/gospel-teaching-and-learning-a-handbook-for-teachers-and-leaders-in-seminaries-and-institutes-of-religion/continuing-to-improve-as-a-teacher.f1"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/10581/10581_all_006_01-praying.jpg"}]],["p.para",{"id":"p4","uri":"/manual/gospel-teaching-and-learning-a-handbook-for-teachers-and-leaders-in-seminaries-and-institutes-of-religion/continuing-to-improve-as-a-teacher.p4"},"One of the most valuable sources of feedback can be self-assessment under the guidance of the Holy Ghost.
