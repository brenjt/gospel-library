The bright glare of the sun was no doubt a cause of blindness, as was also infection or disease. There are many instances of Jesus healing the blind. Indeed, part of His mission as foretold by Isaiah included “recovering of sight to the blind” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/4.18-22"},"Luke 4:18–22"],"), which is noted in the Septuagint text of",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/isa/61.1-2"},"Isa. 61:1–2"],".
