Knowledge of divine and spiritual things is absolutely essential for one’s salvation; hence the gospel is to be taught to every soul. “How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/rom/10.14"},"Rom. 10:14"],"). Knowledge is not obtained all at once, even by revelation, but line upon line, precept upon precept (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/isa/28.9-10"},"Isa. 28:9–10"],"). The scriptures, and also living prophets, are given so that the people might have knowledge of things of God and “know how to worship, and know what you worship” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.19"},"D&C 93:19"],"). Knowledge is one of the endowments of the Holy Ghost (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/14.26"},"John 14:26"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/16.13"},"16:13"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/34.10"},"D&C 34:10"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.26-33"},"121:26–33"],") and one of the gifts of the Spirit (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12.8"},"1 Cor. 12:8"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.10"},"Moro. 10:10"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.18"},"D&C 46:18"],"). Peter lists knowledge along with faith, patience, kindness, and virtue as necessary acquisitions for one who would seek for a divine nature (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.3-9"},"2 Pet. 1:3–9"],"). Since no one can be saved in ignorance of the gospel (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.6"},"D&C 131:6"],"), and one progresses only as fast as he gains knowledge (",["span.small","HC"],"4:588), it follows that the person who gains knowledge will have “the advantage in the world to come” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.18-19"},"D&C 130:18–19"],")."],["div",{"id":"p2","uri":"/scriptures/bd/knowledge.p2","order":".000.2002"},"Other references showing the importance of gaining knowledge are",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/prov/1.20-33"},"Prov. 1:20–33"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/prov/3.13-26"},"3:13–26"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/prov/4.1-13"},"4:1–13"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/prov/8"},"8"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/prov/15.14"},"15:14"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/prov/24.3-4"},"24:3–4"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/17.3"},"John 17:3"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/philip/3.8"},"Philip. 3:8"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.7"},"2 Ne. 32:7"],"."]]],"refs":null}
