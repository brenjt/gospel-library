They are the words of the Lord. But I say that the living oracles of the Church are worth more than all of them. If we could have but one of them, give me the living oracles of the Priesthood for my guidance. Of course, it is proper and a good thing to have it all, because the living oracles of the Church work in harmony with what is written, and their counsel will not come in conflict with the words of the Lord in former ages. But the conditions of mankind change. The counsel that was suitable for the Saints forty years ago may not be so suitable today. Hence the importance of having in our midst the living oracles of God to guide us day by day in the performance of our labors” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1897, 6)."],[".para","Elder Anthony W.

It is not enough that we understand only the dispensation in which we live.

We must understand the harmony that exists between all these gospel dispensations, and then we will begin to understand how admirably our work fits in the time, and the place, and the manner in which the Lord has decreed that it should come about. The work that He has decreed, that He has accomplished is all in harmony with the words of the prophets which have been spoken since the beginning” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1908, 15)."]]]],["div",{"id":"f4","uri":"/manual/scripture-study-the-power-of-the-word-teacher-manual/lesson-8.f4"},["ol.number",["li",["span.label",["b","2."]],[".para",["b","There are various sources of prophetic commentary."]]]]],["div",{"id":"f5","uri":"/manual/scripture-study-the-power-of-the-word-teacher-manual/lesson-8.f5"},["ol.bullet",["li",["span.label","•"],[".para","Following are several examples that may be used to illustrate prophetic interpretation of scriptures."],[".para","Divide the class into groups and give each group source material that contains prophetic commentary about the scriptures.
