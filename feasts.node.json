Two Passovers of the deepest interest were the Passover of the death of our Lord and the last Passover of the Jewish dispensation. Titus with his army shut up in Jerusalem those who came to keep the latter. The city was thus overcrowded, and the sufferings of the besieged by famine, etc., were terribly increased. Since the destruction of Jerusalem the Jews have kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread but not the Feast of the Passover—that is, they do not offer the sacrificial lamb.

The sacrifices prescribed by the law were more numerous than for any other feast, and impressive ceremonies were added in later times; that is, (1) the drawing of water from Siloam and its libation on the altar (of this it was said that he who has not seen the joy of the drawing of water at the Feast of Tabernacles does not know what joy is); and (2) the illumination of the temple courts by four golden candelabra.
