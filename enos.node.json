Enos wrestled before God in mighty prayer before his sins were forgiven. He then prayed for the spiritual welfare of the Nephites and the Lamanites, and he spent the remainder of his life laboring for their salvation. As students study the book of Enos, they can discover important lessons about prayer, repentance, and revelation. They can also learn that as individuals receive the blessings of the Atonement, they will desire to share those blessings with others."]],[".topic",{"id":"t2","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/enos/enos.t2"},["h2","Who wrote this book?"],["p.para",{"id":"p5","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/enos/enos.p5"},"Enos, a son of Jacob and a grandson of Lehi and Sariah, wrote this book.

Next, he recognized his need for the Savior and prayed for forgiveness (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.2-4"},"Enos 1:2–4"],"). Then, after receiving a remission of his sins, he prayed and labored diligently to bring others to salvation (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.5-27"},"Enos 1:5–27"],"). This pattern appears throughout the Book of Mormon.
