Even in a palace the furniture of a room consisted only of a few mats or rugs, the divan or row of cushions against the wall, and some low, moveable tables. At the entrance there was usually a fountain at which guests could wash off dust. In a humbler house, instead of the fountain there was a basin and ewer, while instead of rugs and cushions there were mats and shawls. In our Lordâ€™s time the Roman practice had come in of lying on couches at meal times, supported on one elbow, with a cushion under the arm to relieve the pressure. When the company was large the couches would be arrayed in the form of a horseshoe. The occupants reclined with their heads near the edge of the table and their feet sloping outwards, so that the feet might be washed without the table being disturbed (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/7.38"},"Luke 7:38"],"). Except in winter people freely slept in the open air, but raised bedsteads were also found in most houses (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/4.21"},"Mark 4:21"],")."]]],"refs":null}
