Though earth life is a test for mankind in that they do not know the results, it is not so with God. He has designed mortality as a time of proving, knowing what the results will be. To make his point, one method the teacher might consider using is that of comparison, wherein the students note the similarities between two given things. This concept could be developed by citing the way heat, chemicals, and pressure are necessary in making steel from iron and likening it to the way in which the Lord proves his children. The blacksmith knows what can happen if the right amount of each of the above things is used. It is not a test, for the results are known. Therefore, the metal is proved, not tested, under the fire of the forge and between the anvil and hammer. How has God designed earth life to be a time of proving? What happens to those who yield to God under the furnace of affliction? Did Paul understand this principle? Use some of the scriptures listed in the study sources to show that the prophets tried to help us understand this principle."]]]]],"refs":null}
