Having completed their mission, “on the 8th day of August, 1831, at the close of the first conference held in Missouri, the elders inquired what they were to do.

But the Lord was not pleased with some of them. President Joseph Fielding Smith noted: “They had been commanded to preach the Gospel along the way and bear testimony among the people, but some had failed to magnify this commandment because of their fear of man. It is true that not every man is a natural missionary, and there are those who shrink from the responsibility of raising their voices in proclamation of the Gospel, and yet this is an obligation that we owe to this fallen world. The elders in the very beginning had been commanded to serve the Lord with all their ‘heart, might, mind and strength,’ for the field is white and ready for the harvest. A penalty was to be inflicted upon those who failed and they were not to stand blameless at the last day. The preaching of the Gospel was to be a means to them by which they were not to perish, but bring salvation to their souls. There are many who have been sent forth who have had a fear of man, yet the Lord has promised to support them in their labors if they will trust in him.” (",["span.emphasis","Church History and Modern Revelation,"],"1:220–21.)"],[".",{"id":"f1","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-60-68/section-60-thou-shalt-not-idle-away-thy-time-nor-bury-thy-talents.f1"},[".caption","Those who have been warned are to warn their neighbors."]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/60.4"},"D&C 60:4"],". “I Shall Make Up My Jewels”"],["div",{"id":"p4","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-60-68/section-60-thou-shalt-not-idle-away-thy-time-nor-bury-thy-talents.p4"},"In all ages jewels have been highly esteemed by man.

The action of shaking or cleansing the dust from one’s feet is a testimony against those who refuse to accept the gospel (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/24.15"},"D&C 24:15"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.92"},"84:92"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/99.4"},"99:4"],"). Because of the serious nature of this act, Church leaders have directed that it be done only at the command of the Spirit. President Joseph Fielding Smith explained: “The cleansing of their feet, either by washing or wiping off the dust, would be recorded in heaven as a testimony against the wicked. This act, however, was not to be performed in the presence of the offenders, ‘lest thou provoke them, but in secret, and wash thy feet, as a testimony against them in the day of judgment.’ The missionaries of the Church who faithfully perform their duty are under the obligation of leaving their testimony with all with whom they come in contact in their work. This testimony will stand as a witness against those who reject the message, at the judgment.” (",["span.emphasis","Church History and Modern Revelation,"],"1:223; see also",["a.crossRef",{"href":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/sections-21-29/section-24-declare-my-gospel-as-with-the-voice-of-a-trump.p1"},"Notes and Commentary for D&C 24:15"],".)"]]]]],"refs":null}
