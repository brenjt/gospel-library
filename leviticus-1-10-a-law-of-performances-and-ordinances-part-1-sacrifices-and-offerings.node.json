Hence it was always accompanied by confession of sin and prayer. It was thus done. The sacrifice was so turned that the person confessing looked towards the west, while he laid his hands between the horns of the sacrifice, and if the sacrifice was brought by more than one, each had to lay on his hands. It is not quite a settled point whether one or both hands were laid on; but all are agreed that it was to be done ‘with one’s whole force’—as it were, to lay one’s whole weight upon the substitute.” (Edersheim, The Temple, pp. 113–14.)"],["p.para",{"id":"p93","uri":"/manual/old-testament-student-manual-genesis-2-samuel/leviticus-1-10-a-law-of-performances-and-ordinances-part-1-sacrifices-and-offerings.p93"},"This practice shows that the sacrifice had a dual symbolism. First and foremost, it represented the only sacrifice that could ultimately bring peace and remission of sins, namely that of Jesus Christ. But the laying on of hands showed a transfer of identity; that is, the offerer put his own identity upon the sacrificial animal. Thus, the slaying of the animal implied symbolically one of two things, depending on the kind of offering. First, it implied that the sinful self, the “natural man,” as King Benjamin called it (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19"},"Mosiah 3:19"],"), was put to death in order that the spiritual person could be reborn.

Why? Because the “old man” of sin is buried there (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/rom/6.6"},"Romans 6:6"],").

Death is the consequence of sin and so the animal was slain to show what happens when man sins. Also, the animal was a type of Christ. Through the giving of His life for man, by the shedding of His blood, one who is spiritually dead because of sin can find new life.
