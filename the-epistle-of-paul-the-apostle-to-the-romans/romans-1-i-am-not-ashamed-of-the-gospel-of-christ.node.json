Paul said he was not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and his actions proved it. Elder David B.

His faith and determination lifted him from being a tentmaker to become a teacher, a missionary, leader, and organizer of Christian branches. He most certainly wasn’t a sissy nor weak. People of great faith know what is right and do it. They have uncompromised determination and commitment and are capable of enduring pressure or hardship. Paul knew what was right, and you know what is right. When you take courage like Paul and do what you know is right, nothing will stop your progress but yourself” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1991, 50; or",["span.emphasis","Ensign,"],"Nov. 1991, 36–37)."],[".",{"id":"f2","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-epistle-of-paul-the-apostle-to-the-romans/romans-1-i-am-not-ashamed-of-the-gospel-of-christ.f2"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-112-1.gif"}]],["p.para",{"id":"p17","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-epistle-of-paul-the-apostle-to-the-romans/romans-1-i-am-not-ashamed-of-the-gospel-of-christ.p17"},"Turn to “Paul” in your Bible Dictionary (pp. 742–43).
