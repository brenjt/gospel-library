Captain Moroni rejoiced in learning about Helaman’s successes, but he was angry at the government for neglecting to send reinforcements. Captain Moroni wrote a letter of rebuke to the chief judge, Pahoran. In his reply, Pahoran told of a rebellion against the government. Moroni marched to his aid and defeated the rebels. Then the Nephite armies were able to unitedly defeat the Lamanites.
