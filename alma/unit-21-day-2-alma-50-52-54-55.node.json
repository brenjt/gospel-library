The Nephites were successful against the Lamanites until rebellion and wickedness began to weaken them. Despite Moroni’s efforts to unite and defend the people, the Nephites lost many cities because of contention among themselves. Eventually, Moroni, Teancum, and Lehi recaptured the city of Mulek and defeated one of the largest Lamanite armies. Ammoron, the wicked leader of the Lamanites, attempted to negotiate an exchange of prisoners, but Moroni freed the Nephite prisoners without bloodshed.
