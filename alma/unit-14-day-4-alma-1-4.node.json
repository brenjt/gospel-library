He killed a righteous man and was executed for his crime. Some years later, Amlici tried unsuccessfully to become king over the Nephites. When the people voted to reject him as king, he gathered his supporters—called Amlicites—to go to battle against the Nephites. The Nephites prevailed, but tens of thousands of people were killed. Feeling humbled by the war, many Nephites remembered their duty, and thousands joined the Church. However, within a year, many members of the Church had become proud and were persecuting others. Alma decided to give up his duties as the chief judge and focus on bearing witness of the gospel of Jesus Christ."],[".image",{"id":"f1","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-14-day-4-alma-1-4.f1"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/09410/154061.jpg"}]]],[".topic",{"id":"t5","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-14-day-4-alma-1-4.t5"},["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/1"},"Alma 1"]],["h3","Church members prosper despite the spread of priestcraft and persecution"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-14-day-4-alma-1-4.p7"},"People sometimes seek to be popular.
