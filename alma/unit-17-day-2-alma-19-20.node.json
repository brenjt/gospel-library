Ammon and King Lamoni traveled to the land of Middoni to deliver Ammon’s imprisoned brethren. On the way, they encountered Lamoni’s father, who was king over all the Lamanites. Ammon’s bold testimony and loving protection of Lamoni led King Lamoni’s father to soften his heart and consent to the release of Ammon’s brethren. Because of Ammon’s testimony and example, many people felt the influence of the Holy Ghost and were taught the gospel and converted."]],[".topic",{"id":"t44","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-17-day-2-alma-19-20.t44"},["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/19"},"Alma 19"]],["h3","King Lamoni and many of his people repent and are baptized"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-17-day-2-alma-19-20.p7"},"Think about the outward rippling effect that occurs when you drop a rock into a pool of water."],["p.para",{"id":"p8","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-17-day-2-alma-19-20.p8"},"How can a person’s actions be like the rock that was dropped into the water?"],["p.para",{"id":"p9","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-17-day-2-alma-19-20.p9"},"Write",["span.emphasis","Ammon"],"on the center point (the oval) of the following diagram."],[".image",{"id":"f108","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-17-day-2-alma-19-20.f108"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/09410/1032919.jpg"}]],["p.para",{"id":"p10","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-17-day-2-alma-19-20.p10"},"Read",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/19.1,6"},"Alma 19:1, 6"],"to find out who was first influenced by Ammon’s testimony, and write the name on the first ring of the diagram.
