Many Lamanites began to believe in the Lord, repented, and called themselves the Anti-Nephi-Lehies. After the Anti-Nephi-Lehies made a covenant with God to never again take up weapons of war, the Amalekites and Lamanites began to make preparations to go to battle against them. To help them keep their covenant with the Lord, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies accepted an offer of protection from the Nephites. The Nephite prophet Alma expressed the joy he felt from preaching the gospel and inviting others to come unto Jesus Christ."]],[".topic",{"id":"t53","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-18-day-1-alma-25-29.t53"},["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/25"},"Alma 25"]],["h3","Abinadi’s prophecy is fulfilled, and many Lamanites are converted"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-18-day-1-alma-25-29.p7"},"Think about any changes you have made as you have become more converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ.",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/25"},"Alma 25"],"tells of the fulfillment of Abinadi’s prophecy that descendants of the priests of Noah would be hunted down and killed and shows that the Lord vindicates His prophets and fulfills their inspired prophecies (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/25.9"},"Alma 25:9"],").
