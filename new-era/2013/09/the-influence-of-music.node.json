Two researchers explored this relationship by studying the effects of music and rhythm on the nervous system of mice. For eight weeks, one group of mice constantly listened to Strauss waltzes (highly organized and orderly music), while a second heard disharmonious sounds in the form of continuous drumbeats. A third group was raised in silence."],["p.para",{"id":"p19","uri":"/new-era/2013/09/the-influence-of-music.p19"},"After eight weeks, the mice were placed in a maze to find food. The mice in the second group wandered off with no sense of direction—“a clear indication they were having trouble learning”—and took much longer to find the food than they had at the beginning of the study. The mice exposed “to discordant sounds not only developed difficulties in learning and memory, … but they also incurred structural changes in their brain cells.” The researchers’ diagnosis is very interesting: “We believe that the mice were trying to compensate for this constant bombardment of disharmonic noise. … They were struggling against the chaos.”",["sup",["a",{"href":"fn_footnote5"},"5"]]],["p.para",{"id":"p20","uri":"/new-era/2013/09/the-influence-of-music.p20"},"What could be the “chaos” in some of today’s music—things that might keep you from learning effectively? It may relate to the rhythm and beat of the music (as with the mice) or with the words used or messages presented. President Boyd K. Packer, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, said: “Society is undergoing a subtle, but powerful, change. It is becoming more and more permissive in what it will accept in its entertainment. As a result, much of the music being performed by popular entertainers today seems to be more intended to agitate than to pacify, more to excite than to calm.”",["sup",["a",{"href":"fn_footnote6"},"6"]]]],[".topic",{"id":"t3","uri":"/new-era/2013/09/the-influence-of-music.t3"},[".title","Matters of Time and the Spirit"],["p.para",{"id":"p22","uri":"/new-era/2013/09/the-influence-of-music.p22"},"It is not only the rhythm and the lyrics of jarring music that are detrimental.
