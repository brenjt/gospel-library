President Howard W. Hunter (1907–95) said: “I get concerned when it appears that strong emotion or free-flowing tears are equated with the presence of the Spirit. Certainly the Spirit of the Lord can bring strong emotional feelings, including tears, but that outward manifestation ought not to be confused with the presence of the Spirit itself” (in",["span.emphasis","Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service"],"[2004], 99)."],["p.para",{"id":"p3","uri":"/new-era/2013/07/to-the-point/a-lot-of-people-cry-when-they-feel-the-spirit-but-i-dont-is-there-something-wrong-with-me.p3"},"The Spirit of God brings peace and clarity to your heart and mind, as well as other positive emotions, such as love, joy, meekness, and patience (see",["a",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.15,23"},"D&C 6:15, 23"],";",["a",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.12-14"},"11:12–14"],";",["a",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/gal/5.22-23"},"Galatians 5:22–23"],").

This includes intercourse; touching the private, sacred parts of another person’s body, with or without clothing; arousing sexual feelings in others or yourself for the purpose of gratification; viewing or sending pornography; reading pornographic literature; deliberately dwelling on sexual thoughts; and talking or texting about sex in an explicit manner with the intent of arousing sexual feelings.

You simply need to commit to stay pure. As President Gordon B. Hinckley (1910–2008) said, “There is a line which you must not cross. It is the line that separates personal cleanliness from sin. I need not get clinical in telling you where that line is. You know. You have been told again and again. You have a conscience within you. Stay on the Lord’s side of the line” (“‘Be Ye Clean,’”",["span.emphasis","Ensign,"],"May 1996, 48). Staying on the Lord’s side of the line is worth it because of the blessings it brings (see Elder David A.
