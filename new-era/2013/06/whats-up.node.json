Their activities included babysitting, making blueberry jam for new members in the ward, packing food at the bishops’ storehouse, scraping wallpaper in a member’s home, picking up garbage at a local playground, and more. “I thought it would be exhausting,” says Ann M., “but it was really fun!”"],["p.para",{"id":"p4","uri":"/new-era/2013/06/whats-up/summer-of-service.p4"},"While the young women certainly helped plenty of people in their ward, they also looked for others to serve.
