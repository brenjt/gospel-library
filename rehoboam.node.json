During his reign the division took place between north and south (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/12"},"1 Kgs. 12"],"), being mainly the result of an old rivalry between Judah and Ephraim, which Rehoboam tried to pacify by going to Shechem to be crowned. Much discontent had also been caused by the rigor of Solomon’s government, and by Rehoboam’s refusal to relieve the burdens placed upon the people (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/12.1-11"},"1 Kgs. 12:1–11"],"). An invasion by Shishak, king of Egypt, also weakened Rehoboam’s power (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/14.21-31"},"1 Kgs. 14:21–31"],").
