The supposed deception of his father in obtaining the blessing (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/gen/27"},"Gen. 27"],") cannot be taken at face value. The Lord is not obligated to bless an unworthy person simply because gracious words were pronounced upon him by mistake. The key to the matter is expressed in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/gen/27.33"},"Gen. 27:33"],"wherein Isaac, after learning Jacob’s true identity, said, “Yea, and he shall be blessed.” Isaac could have revoked the blessing at that time, but he seemed to affirm that it had been rightly delivered. Jacob’s subsequent life demonstrates that he deserved the blessing he received, while Esau’s life shows disobedience and some displeasing choices of wives (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/gen/26.34-35"},"Gen. 26:34–35"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/gen/28.8-9"},"28:8–9"],"). The so-called purchase of the birthright from Esau may very well be equally justified by items of Esau’s errant behavior that disqualified him but that are not recorded in our Bible.
