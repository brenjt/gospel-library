Even the farmers, who in this country generally weed their fields, do not attempt to separate the one from the other. … The taste is bitter, and, when eaten separately, or even when diffused in ordinary bread, it causes dizziness, and often acts as a violent emetic.”’ The secondary quotation is from Thompson’s",["span.emphasis","The Land and the Book,"],"ii. 111, 112.
