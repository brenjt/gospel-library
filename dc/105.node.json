Under the leadership of the Prophet, Saints from Ohio and other areas marched to Missouri in an expedition later known as Zion’s Camp. Their purpose was to escort the expelled Missouri Saints back to their lands in Jackson County. Missourians who had previously persecuted the Saints feared retaliation from Zion’s Camp and preemptively attacked some Saints living in Clay County, Missouri. After the Missouri governor withdrew his promise to support the Saints, Joseph Smith received this revelation."]],[".studySummary",["i",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.1-5"},"1–5"],", Zion will be built up by conformity to celestial law;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.6-13"},"6–13"],", The redemption of Zion is deferred for a little season;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.14-19"},"14–19"],", The Lord will fight the battles of Zion;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.20-26"},"20–26"],", The Saints are to be wise and not boast of mighty works as they gather;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.27-30"},"27–30"],", Lands in Jackson and adjoining counties should be purchased;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.31-34"},"31–34"],", The elders are to receive an endowment in the house of the Lord in Kirtland;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.35-37"},"35–37"],", Saints who are both called and chosen will be sanctified;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.38-41"},"38–41"],", The Saints are to lift an ensign of peace to the world."]]],[".bodyBlock",["div",{"id":"1","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.1","order":"06.05.105.13425"},["b","1"],"Verily I say unto you who have assembled yourselves together that you may learn my will concerning the",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_1a"},"redemption"],"of mine afflicted people—"],["div",{"id":"2","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.2","order":"06.05.105.13426"},["b","2"],"Behold, I say unto you, were it not for the",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_2a"},"transgressions"],"of my people, speaking concerning the church and not individuals, they might have been redeemed even now."],["div",{"id":"3","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.3","order":"06.05.105.13427"},["b","3"],"But behold, they have not learned to be obedient to the things which I required at their hands, but are full of all manner of evil, and do not",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_3a"},"impart"],"of their substance, as becometh saints, to the poor and afflicted among them;"],["div",{"id":"4","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.4","order":"06.05.105.13428"},["b","4"],"And are not",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_4a"},"united"],"according to the union required by the law of the celestial kingdom;"],["div",{"id":"5","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.5","order":"06.05.105.13429"},["b","5"],"And",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_5a"},"Zion"],"cannot be built up",["sup","b"],["a",{"href":"fn_5b"},"unless"],"it is by the",["sup","c"],["a",{"href":"fn_5c"},"principles"],"of the",["sup","d"],["a",{"href":"fn_5d"},"law"],"of the celestial kingdom; otherwise I cannot receive her unto myself."],["div",{"id":"6","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.6","order":"06.05.105.13430"},["b","6"],"And my people must needs be",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_6a"},"chastened"],"until they learn",["sup","b"],["a",{"href":"fn_6b"},"obedience"],", if it must needs be, by the things which they",["sup","c"],["a",{"href":"fn_6c"},"suffer"],"."],["div",{"id":"7","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.7","order":"06.05.105.13431"},["b","7"],"I speak not concerning those who are appointed to lead my people, who are the",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_7a"},"first"],"elders of my church, for they are not all under this condemnation;"],["div",{"id":"8","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.8","order":"06.05.105.13432"},["b","8"],"But I speak concerning my churches abroad—there are many who will say: Where is their God?
