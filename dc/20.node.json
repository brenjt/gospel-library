The Prophet wrote, “We obtained of Him [Jesus Christ] the following, by the spirit of prophecy and revelation; which not only gave us much information, but also pointed out to us the precise day upon which, according to His will and commandment, we should proceed to organize His Church once more here upon the earth.”"]],[".studySummary",["i",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.1-16"},"1–16"],", The Book of Mormon proves the divinity of the latter-day work;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.17-28"},"17–28"],", The doctrines of creation, fall, atonement, and baptism are affirmed;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.29-37"},"29–37"],", Laws governing repentance, justification, sanctification, and baptism are set forth;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.38-67"},"38–67"],", Duties of elders, priests, teachers, and deacons are summarized;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.68-74"},"68–74"],", Duties of members, blessing of children, and the mode of baptism are revealed;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.75-84"},"75–84"],", Sacramental prayers and regulations governing Church membership are given."]]],[".bodyBlock",["div",{"id":"1","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.1","order":"06.05.020.2445"},["b","1"],"The",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_1a"},"rise"],"of the",["sup","b"],["a",{"href":"fn_1b"},"Church"],"of Christ in these last days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the",["sup","c"],["a",{"href":"fn_1c"},"coming"],"of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh, it being regularly",["sup","d"],["a",{"href":"fn_1d"},"organized"],"and established agreeable to the",["sup","e"],["a",{"href":"fn_1e"},"laws"],"of our country, by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April—"],["div",{"id":"2","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.2","order":"06.05.020.2446"},["b","2"],"Which commandments were given to Joseph Smith, Jun., who was",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_2a"},"called"],"of God, and",["sup","b"],["a",{"href":"fn_2b"},"ordained"],"an",["sup","c"],["a",{"href":"fn_2c"},"apostle"],"of Jesus Christ, to be the",["sup","d"],["a",{"href":"fn_2d"},"first"],["sup","e"],["a",{"href":"fn_2e"},"elder"],"of this church;"],["div",{"id":"3","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.3","order":"06.05.020.2447"},["b","3"],"And to Oliver Cowdery, who was also called of God, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_3a"},"second"],"elder of this church, and ordained under his hand;"],["div",{"id":"4","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.4","order":"06.05.020.2448"},["b","4"],"And this according to the",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_4a"},"grace"],"of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory, both now and forever.
