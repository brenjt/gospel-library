Herein the Lord informs Joseph of alterations made by wicked men in the 116 manuscript pages from the translation of the book of Lehi, in the Book of Mormon. These manuscript pages had been lost from the possession of Martin Harris, to whom the sheets had been temporarily entrusted. (See the",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.head"},"heading to section 3"],".) The evil design was to await the expected retranslation of the matter covered by the stolen pages and then to discredit the translator by showing discrepancies created by the alterations. That this wicked purpose had been conceived by the evil one and was known to the Lord even while Mormon, the ancient Nephite historian, was making his abridgment of the accumulated plates, is shown in the Book of Mormon (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1.3-7"},"Words of Mormon 1:3–7"],")."]],[".studySummary",["i",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.1-26"},"1–26"],", Satan stirs up wicked men to oppose the Lord’s work;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.27-33"},"27–33"],", He seeks to destroy the souls of men;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.34-52"},"34–52"],", The gospel is to go to the Lamanites and all nations through the Book of Mormon;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.53-63"},"53–63"],", The Lord will establish His Church and His gospel among men;",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.64-70"},"64–70"],", He will gather the repentant into His Church and will save the obedient."]]],[".bodyBlock",["div",{"id":"1","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.1","order":"06.05.010.1347"},["b","1"],"Now, behold, I say unto you, that because you",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_1a"},"delivered up"],"those writings which you had power given unto you to translate by the means of the",["sup","b"],["a",{"href":"fn_1b"},"Urim and Thummim"],", into the hands of a wicked man, you have lost them."],["div",{"id":"2","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.2","order":"06.05.010.1348"},["b","2"],"And you also lost your gift at the same time, and your",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_2a"},"mind"],"became",["sup","b"],["a",{"href":"fn_2b"},"darkened"],"."],["div",{"id":"3","uri":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.3","order":"06.05.010.1349"},["b","3"],"Nevertheless, it is now",["sup","a"],["a",{"href":"fn_3a"},"restored"],"unto you again;
