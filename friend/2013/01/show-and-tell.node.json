I asked that we could show Heavenly Father how kind we could be that day. Later I got upset with my brother and was sent to my room to calm down. When my mom came to talk to me, I told her I remembered what I had said in my prayer that morning and that I didn’t feel upset with my brother anymore. She said the Holy Ghost was helping me remember those words about being kind. I was able to make better choices the rest of the day. I’m grateful for prayer and for the Holy Ghost."],[".bio",["div",{"id":"p3","uri":"/friend/2013/01/show-and-tell.p3"},"Maren E., age 5, Utah, USA"]]],["div",{"id":"f2","uri":"/friend/2013/01/show-and-tell.f2"},["div",{"id":"p4","uri":"/friend/2013/01/show-and-tell.p4"},"On my sixth birthday my parents gave me a Book of Mormon with their testimonies written inside the front cover. They challenged me to read it before my eighth birthday and baptism. As part of my bedtime routine, I read the Book of Mormon every night. Sometimes I read it while driving around or at the beach. The more I read, the better I became at reading. When I was seven and a half years old, I finished the Book of Mormon. It strengthened my testimony, and I know that the Book of Mormon is true. I feel prepared for my baptism and am excited for it. I have started to read the Book of Mormon again."],[".bio",["div",{"id":"p5","uri":"/friend/2013/01/show-and-tell.p5"},"Lana B., age 7, Hawaii, USA"]]],["div",{"id":"f3","uri":"/friend/2013/01/show-and-tell.f3"},["div",{"id":"p6","uri":"/friend/2013/01/show-and-tell.p6"},"I like to help my mom around the house.
