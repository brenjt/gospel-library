Cut out the “Surprise Service” note above and look for chances to surprise someone by serving them when they’re not looking. When you do surprise service for someone, leave the note where they will find it. For example, you could make a sibling’s bed and leave the note on the bed for them to find. Then it is that person’s turn to do a surprise act of service for someone else! See how many times your family members can pass around the note in one week."]],[".topic",{"id":"t2","uri":"/friend/2013/07/bulletin-board.t2"},[".title","I Love to See the Temple"],["p.para",{"id":"p5","uri":"/friend/2013/07/bulletin-board.p5"},"Have you met Erika yet?
