I did not want to postpone my baptism. I felt I should go ahead on the appointed day. Many relatives and friends, some of whom are not members of the Church, came to my baptism. When I was baptized, my fever went down right away, and I felt a lot better. That day I felt the Holy Ghost very strongly. I am grateful that I could be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost."],[".bio",["p.para",{"id":"p3","uri":"/friend/2013/09/show-and-tell.p3"},"Sara M., age 8, Spain"]]],[".quote",{"id":"f76","uri":"/friend/2013/09/show-and-tell.f76"},["p.para",{"id":"p4","uri":"/friend/2013/09/show-and-tell.p4"},"One winter my mom was sick for four months.
