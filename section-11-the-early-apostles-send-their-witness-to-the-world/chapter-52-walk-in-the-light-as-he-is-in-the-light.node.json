Suppose that you had heard him teach, had seen the miracles he had performed, and had felt by the Spirit the power of the testimony he bore of himself—that he came into the world to do the will of the Father, which included giving his life. Further, suppose you were a witness to his resurrection and had been privileged and worthy enough to see and feel the wounds made during his sacrifice, in part, for your sins. How would you feel toward the Savior? How would you feel about a teaching spreading among some of your fellow Christians that Jesus didn’t really suffer for anyone’s sins but merely seemed to do so? Further, that he really wasn’t a partaker of mortality but only appeared to be, and that the physical body the Lord displayed after the resurrection was an illusion? This was the problem faced by the apostle John. It appears that some Christians had adopted an early form of Gnosticism and were teaching that Jesus could not have truly come in the flesh, for God is holy and could have nothing to do with contaminating matter. To explain the Savior’s presence on earth, the Gnostics set forth two arguments: either Christ was only apparently human or else the spirit which inhabited Jesus’ mortal body descended into the man Jesus at the time of his commitment to God in baptism and departed just prior to his suffering on the cross. Thus Christ did not really suffer for our sins; it was only the man Jesus who was crucified. The first of these philosophies was known as Docetism, so called from the Greek word dokeo, “to seem or appear,” and the latter was known as Cerinthianism, named for Cerinthus, its primary proponent in the first century."],["p.para",{"id":"p39","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-11-the-early-apostles-send-their-witness-to-the-world/chapter-52-walk-in-the-light-as-he-is-in-the-light.p39"},"John wrote, among other reasons, to dispel such notions.
