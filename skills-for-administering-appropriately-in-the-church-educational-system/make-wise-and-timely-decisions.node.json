Poor decisions inhibit progress. CES leaders face many situations that require wise decisions to be made: hiring, placement, performance appraisals, program development, training, curriculum, budgeting, enrollment, development and care of physical facilities, and acquisition of properties. These decisions affect CES, the Church, and the lives of individuals. Wise decisions should be based on gospel principles. It is, therefore, essential to understand the underlying gospel principles inherent in a particular decision.
