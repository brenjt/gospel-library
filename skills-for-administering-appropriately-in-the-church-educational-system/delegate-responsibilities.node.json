Although delegation may initially require more of a leader’s time, in the long term it often saves time. Delegating also helps leaders draw upon the abilities and resources of others. It helps them recognize the worth of others. It helps build relationships of trust between the leader and the one receiving the assignment. Delegating responsibilities helps individuals have opportunities for growth through participation, develops them for future leadership, and helps motivate them in their assignments."]],[".topic",{"id":"t11","uri":"/manual/administering-appropriately-a-handbook-for-ces-leaders-and-teachers/skills-for-administering-appropriately-in-the-church-educational-system/delegate-responsibilities.t11"},["h2","Giving and Receiving Assignments"],["p.para",{"id":"p9","uri":"/manual/administering-appropriately-a-handbook-for-ces-leaders-and-teachers/skills-for-administering-appropriately-in-the-church-educational-system/delegate-responsibilities.p9"},"Elder James E.
