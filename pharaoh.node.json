(2) Pharaoh (also one of the Hyksos) and Joseph (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/gen/39?span=39-50"},"Gen. 39–50"],"). (3) The Pharaohs of oppression, Seti Ⅰ and Ramses Ⅱ, belonging to the 19th dynasty (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/ex/1,2"},"Ex. 1; 2"],"); it is generally believed that the Pharaoh of the Exodus was Mer-ne-ptah, but the discovery of the Tell el-Amarna tablets has thrown doubt on this. (4) The Pharaoh whose daughter Solomon married, perhaps Pi-netchem of the 21st dynasty (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/3.1"},"1 Kgs. 3:1"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/7.8"},"7:8"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/9.16,24"},"9:16, 24"],").
