He saw the land of promise where his family would settle. He saw periods of contention, war, and sinfulness and periods of righteousness and peace among his descendants and the descendants of Laman and Lemuel. He saw the Savior’s ministry in the Americas. He also saw the Great Apostasy, the Restoration of the gospel, Satan’s continuing battle against truth, and the central role of Jesus Christ as the Savior of the world. As students discuss Nephi’s vision and read about the final triumph of God’s kingdom over Satan, they can find comfort in the knowledge that the Lord will remember His covenants with His Saints. You can assure them that despite threats from the devil and those in his kingdom, God is in control and will strengthen His faithful followers as they participate in His work."]],[".topic",["h2","Some Doctrines and Principles"],["ul.bullet",["li",["span.label","•"],[".para","The devil founded a “great and abominable church” to “pervert the right ways of the Lord” (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.1-9,26-29"},"1 Nephi 13:1–9, 26–29"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.9-13"},"14:9–13"],")."]],["li",["span.label","•"],[".para","The Lord has restored plain and precious truths to help us come unto Him (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.20-42"},"1 Nephi 13:20–42"],")."]],["li",["span.label","•"],[".para","Prayer leads to revelation (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.1-11"},"1 Nephi 15:1–11"],")."]],["li",["span.label","•"],[".para","The Lord remembers His covenants with the house of Israel (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.12-20"},"1 Nephi 15:12–20"],")."]]]],[".topic",["h2","Suggestions for Teaching"],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.1-9,26-29"},"1 Nephi 13:1–9, 26–29"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.9-13"},"14:9–13"],".
