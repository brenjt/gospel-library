(See",["span.emphasis","Webster’s Third New International Dictionary,"],"s.v. “church.”) With these definitions in mind, examine the evidence that Jesus organized a church. Two Apostles wrote anciently that in the meridian of time, Jesus chose Apostles (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/10.1-10"},"Matthew 10:1–10"],") and Seventies (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/10.1,17"},"Luke 10:1, 17"],"). Apostles in the latter days have also written about Jesus’ organizing his church in his own day (see",["a.crossRef",{"href":"/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-student-manual/chapter-22-the-apostasy.p15"},"Supporting Statements A"],"on p. 59 of the student manual)."],[".para","Along with an elemental church structure, Jesus also emphasized certain teachings and ordinances that would mark discipleship in his Church. On the day of Pentecost, Peter declared that faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost are necessary steps in joining the Savior’s church and receiving the promised blessings (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/2.37-38"},"Acts 2:37–38"],"). The Savior taught during his ministry that certain ethical and moral requirements are also marks of discipleship (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/14.26"},"Luke 14:26"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/8.31"},"John 8:31"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/13.35"},"John 13:35"],")."]],["li",["span.label","■"],[".para","Steady growth led to rapid expansion of Church organization.

What office in the priesthood appears central in each of these references? (Apostle.) Why was this office, as well as the others, so critical? Paul taught that the Church’s structure existed to bring perfection to the Saints, for the work of the ministry, and to bring unity to the Church (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/eph/4.12-13"},"Ephesians 4:12–13"],")."],[".",{"id":"f","uri":"/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-teacher-manual.f"}]]]]],["li",["span.label","B."],[".para","A great apostasy from the Savior’s church was foretold."],["div",{"id":"f","uri":"/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-teacher-manual.f"},["ol.content-list alpha-caps",["li",["span.label","■"],[".para","Study",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/isa/24.5"},"Isaiah 24:5"],"and",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/amos/8.11-12"},"Amos 8:11–12"],". What do these two Old Testament scriptures teach about the Apostasy? Show how they are classic definitions of apostasy. They prophesy that the ordinances will be changed and the covenants broken and that the people will experience a famine of hearing the word of the Lord (see",["a.crossRef",{"href":"/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-student-manual/chapter-22-the-apostasy.p19"},"Supporting Statements B"],"on p. 59 of the student manual)."]],["li",["span.label","■"],[".para","Many evidences suggest that while the Apostles continued preaching and testifying of Jesus, they knew a general apostasy would take place.
