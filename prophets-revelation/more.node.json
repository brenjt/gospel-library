Monson has said: “Not a day has gone by that I have not communicated with my Father in Heaven through prayer. It is a relationship I cherish—one I would literally be lost without. If you do not now have such a relationship with your Father in Heaven, I urge you to work toward that goal. As you do so, you will be entitled to His inspiration and guidance in your life—necessities for each of us if we are to survive spiritually during our sojourn here on earth. Such inspiration and guidance are gifts He freely gives if we but seek them. What treasures they are! I am always humbled and grateful when my Heavenly Father communicates with me through His inspiration. I have learned to recognize it, to trust it, and to follow it” (“",["a",{"href":"/general-conference/2011/10/stand-in-holy-places"},"Stand in Holy Places,"],"”",["i","Ensign"],"or",["i","Liahona,"],"Nov. 2011, 84)."]],[".circles",["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/youth/bc/youth/learn/ss/prophets-revelation/more/images/prophets-what-can-i-learn-from.jpg"}]]],[".bodyBlock",[".topic",{"id":"t1","uri":"/youth/learn/ss/prophets-revelation/more.t1"},["h2","Prepare yourself spiritually"],[".personalApplication",["p.para",{"id":"p101","uri":"/youth/learn/ss/prophets-revelation/more.p101"},"How has following the promptings of the Holy Ghost blessed your life?
