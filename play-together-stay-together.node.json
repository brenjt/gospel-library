We’d all helped prepare by drawing decorations, hanging lights inside, and covering the floor with beach towels. My dad even joked about putting sunscreen on! We listened to beach music and ate our dinner on the floor. After eating we played our own version of volleyball by tying a string across the room for the “net” while each team tried to blow a feather over the string rather than hitting a ball. Laughing together at the different faces each of us made was the best part of the night. But doing something together as a family—something really fun and different—made it even better."],["p.para",{"id":"p8","uri":"/new-era/2013/06/play-together-stay-together.p8"},"It’s shared activities like these—ones that allow family time together regardless of whether it’s a planned party or a simple, everyday happening—that help us grow closer to our family members. We know that spending time with our family is important, but not every family gathering can be a planned, themed event. So we need to know how to spend time with our parents and siblings from day to day. You can get to know your siblings much better just by doing little things together, such as talking to them at dinner, sharing your headphones to listen to music together, or helping them with a project. Even if your siblings have different interests, trying out new things together may help you find some common ground."]],[".topic",{"id":"t2","uri":"/new-era/2013/06/play-together-stay-together.t2"},[".title","Favorite Youth Experiences"],["p.para",{"id":"p10","uri":"/new-era/2013/06/play-together-stay-together.p10"},"Check out what these youth enjoy doing with their families."],["ul.bullet",["li",["span.label","•"],["p.para","Connor and his family love to play board games together, so they have made one night a week a game night for their family."]],["li",["span.label","•"],["p.para","Cassandra’s family likes to go watch the trains that pass near their house.
