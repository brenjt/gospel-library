Good shepherds were known by the faithful way they cared for and protected their sheep. A true shepherd would walk ahead of the sheep and lead them rather than drive them from behind, and many shepherds even had individual names for their sheep. Unlike someone who was simply hired to take care of the sheep, a shepherd owned his sheep, and he would risk his life for the safety of any one of them. Because sheep trusted those good shepherds, they came when they were called, but they would not follow a stranger.
