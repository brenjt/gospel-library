Other usages of Zion have to do with a geographical location. For example, Enoch built a city that was called Zion (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.18-19"},"Moses 7:18–19"],"); Solomon built his temple on Mount Zion (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/8.1"},"1 Kgs. 8:1"],"; see also",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-sam/5.6-7"},"2 Sam. 5:6–7"],"); and Jackson County, Missouri, is called Zion in many of the revelations in the D&C, such as",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.49-50"},"58:49–50"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/62.4"},"62:4"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.48"},"63:48"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/72.13"},"72:13"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.76"},"84:76"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104.47"},"104:47"],". The city of New Jerusalem, to be built in Jackson County, Missouri, is to be called Zion (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.66-67"},"D&C 45:66–67"],"). The revelations also speak of “the cause of Zion” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.6"},"D&C 6:6"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.6"},"11:6"],").
