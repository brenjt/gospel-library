These laws did not come from the Lord, and many appeared ridiculous—such as the rule that healing on the Sabbath was “work” and therefore forbidden. The Pharisees, the most powerful religious group in Jesus’ day, were very strict in their obedience to these traditions and considered them more important than the words of the prophets.
