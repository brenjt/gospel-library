For three years Jesus traveled among the Jews teaching His gospel, testifying of His mission in both word and action, and setting up His Church on the earth. All He had done up to that time would have been of no use, however, if he did not complete what He prepared Himself to do, as recorded in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/26"},"Matthew 26–28"],"."],[".intro","For over a thousand years, Israelites remembered how the Lord had saved their lives and delivered them from slavery in Egypt with a special ceremony and meal called Passover, or the feast of unleavened bread (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/ex/12"},"Exodus 12–13"],").

Soon after, Jesus Himself would be the Lamb that every Passover lamb was a symbol for. Notice what Jesus did to replace the Passover with another ceremony and ordinance that looks back on—rather than forward to—the Lord’s atoning sacrifice. You will likely notice and feel many other things about the Savior as you carefully read Matthew’s testimony of the events leading up to the Crucifixion of the Lamb of God."]],[".bodyBlock",[".topic",["h2","Other Accounts of What You Read in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/26"},"Matthew
