Hypocrisy is a result of pride. Humble followers of God seek to live according to His laws because they love God and other people—not because they will be recognized or honored for it. When it is pointed out that a humble follower of God is in the wrong, he or she immediately works toward doing what is right. The hypocrite seeks to cover sins and make excuses for them."],[".intro","Throughout your study of the book of Matthew you have read about the hypocrisy of the Jewish leaders in Jesus’ day and how Jesus taught His believers to live the gospel without hypocrisy.",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/23"},"Matthew 23"],"contains Jesus’ final testimony and condemnation against those who refused His teachings and testimonies of the true gospel and plan of eternal happiness."],[".intro","As you read, consider what you would think about this speech if you were a Pharisee and heard it in person.
