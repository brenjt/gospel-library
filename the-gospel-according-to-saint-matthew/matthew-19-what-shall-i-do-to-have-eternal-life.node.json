As a group they had fallen away from the true practice of their religion as revealed by God to Moses. There were many individuals who still lived as righteously as they knew how—such as Mary, Joseph, and John the Baptist. Those who held positions of power and leadership in the Jewish faith, such as the scribes, the Pharisees, and the Sadducees, were especially notable for their apostasy from the truth. They were more concerned with preserving their positions of leadership than with true righteousness. Jesus’ message must have cut straight to their hearts as He condemned their pride and hypocrisy."],[".intro","As you read",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/19"},"Matthew 19"],"and the next few chapters, notice how the Jewish leaders continued to attack and try to embarrass Jesus, while Jesus continued to challenge them by defining what true righteousness is."]],[".bodyBlock",[".topic",["h2","Other Accounts of What You Read in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/19"},"Matthew 19"]],["p.para",{"id":"p585","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-19-what-shall-i-do-to-have-eternal-life.p585"},["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/19.1-9"},"Matthew 19:1–9"],"—",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/10.1-12"},"Mark 10:1–12"]],["p.para",{"id":"p586","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-19-what-shall-i-do-to-have-eternal-life.p586"},["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/19.13-30"},"Matthew 19:13–30"],"—",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/10.13-31"},"Mark 10:13–31"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/18.15-30"},"Luke 18:15–30"]]],[".topic",["h2","Understanding the Scriptures"],[".figure",{"id":"f81","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-19-what-shall-i-do-to-have-eternal-life.f81"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/19"},"Matthew 19"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","Cleave"],"(v. 5)"],["td","Stay with, be closely attached to"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Eunuchs"],"(v. 12)"],["td","Unmarried men who were physically incapable of fathering children (see Bible Dictionary,",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bd/eunuch"},"“eunuch,”"],"p. 667)"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Forsaken"],"(vv. 27, 29)"],["td","Left, given up"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Regeneration"],"(v. 28)"],["td","Resurrection (see the Joseph Smith Translation for this verse)"],["td"]]]]],[".",{"id":"f82","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-19-what-shall-i-do-to-have-eternal-life.f82"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-027-1.gif"}],[".caption",["p",{"id":"lds-"},["span.emphasis","“For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh.”"]]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/19.3-12"},"Matthew 19:3–12"],"—Jesus’ Counsel on Marriage and Divorce"],["p.para",{"id":"p592","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-19-what-shall-i-do-to-have-eternal-life.p592"},"The question the Pharisees asked Jesus was a question debated among the different groups of the Jewish faith.
