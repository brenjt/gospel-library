The quorum or council of the Twelve Apostles as existent in the Church to-day may better be spoken of as the ‘Quorum of the Twelve,’ the ‘Council of the Twelve,’ or simply as the ‘Twelve,’ than as the ‘Twelve Apostles,’ except as particular occasion may warrant the use of the more sacred term. It is advised that the title ‘Apostle’ be not applied as a prefix to the name of any member of the Council of the Twelve; but that such a one be addressed or spoken of as ‘Brother ———,’ or ‘Elder ———,’ and when necessary or desirable, as in announcing his presence in a public assembly, an explanatory clause may be added, thus, ‘Elder ———, one of the Council of the Twelve.’”—From “The Honor and Dignity of Priesthood,” by the author,",["span.emphasis","Improvement Era,"],"vol. 17, No. 5, pp. 409–10."]],["li",["span.label","3."],["p.para",{"id":"p30","uri":"/manual/jesus-the-christ/chapter-16.p30"},["b","“Of Alpheus,” or “Son of Alpheus.”"],"—In all Bible passages specifying “James son of Alpheus” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/10.3"},"Matthew 10:3"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/3.18"},"Mark 3:18"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/6.15"},"Luke 6:15"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/1.13"},"Acts 1:13"],") the word",["span.emphasis","son"],"has been supplied by the translators, and therefore properly appears in",["span.emphasis","italics."],"The phrase in the Greek reads “James of Alpheus.” This fact must not be given undue weight in support of the thought that the James spoken of was not the son of Alpheus; for the word",["span.emphasis","son"],"has been similarly added in the translation of other passages, in all of which",["span.emphasis","italics"],"are used to indicate the words supplied, e.g. “James",["span.emphasis","the son"],"of Zebedee” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/10.2"},"Matthew 10:2"],"; see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/3.17"},"Mark 3:17"],").
