The prophet Samuel was a second witness of Jesus Christ, along with the prophet Nephi. He forewarned the Nephites of their destruction if they did not repent. Samuel confronted them about their tendency to reject the prophets and their disposition to seek happiness in doing iniquity. He announced the signs that would mark the birth and death of Jesus Christ. He also taught that all mankind, through the redemption of Jesus Christ, will be brought back into God’s presence for judgment."]],[".topic",{"id":"t27","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/helaman/unit-23-day-3-helaman-13-14.t27"},["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/hel/13"},"Helaman 13"]],["h3","Samuel warns the Nephites of their destruction if they do not repent"],[".img-left",{"id":"f67","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/helaman/unit-23-day-3-helaman-13-14.f67"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/09410/942080.jpg"}]],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/helaman/unit-23-day-3-helaman-13-14.p7"},"When you have done something wrong and needed to be corrected by a parent or other leader, how did you respond?"],["p.para",{"id":"p8","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/helaman/unit-23-day-3-helaman-13-14.p8"},"The account of a prophet calling a people to repentance recorded in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/hel/13"},"Helaman 13–16"],"is unique because it is the first instance in the Book of Mormon of a Lamanite prophet calling Nephites to repentance."],["p.para",{"id":"p9","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/helaman/unit-23-day-3-helaman-13-14.p9"},"Read",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.1-8,11"},"Helaman 13:1–8, 11"],"to understand why Samuel preached to the Nephites and what the Lord directed him to say.
