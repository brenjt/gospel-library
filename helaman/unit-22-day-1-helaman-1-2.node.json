Pahoran was elected by the people as the new chief judge. One of Paanchi’s followers, a man named Kishkumen who was acting for a secret band, murdered Pahoran, and Pacumeni was then appointed as chief judge. Taking advantage of this contention and division, the Lamanites were able to conquer the Nephites’ capital city of Zarahemla and kill Pacumeni. The Nephite general Moronihah regained the city of Zarahemla, and Helaman was appointed as the chief judge. Kishkumen was slain while attempting to kill Helaman, and Gadianton became the leader of the secret band."]],[".topic",{"id":"t5","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/helaman/unit-22-day-1-helaman-1-2.t5"},["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/hel/1"},"Helaman 1"]],["h3","Contention over who should be chief judge allows the Lamanites to conquer Zarahemla, the capital city of the Nephites"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/helaman/unit-22-day-1-helaman-1-2.p7"},"Think of the last time you had an argument with someone or witnessed others having an argument.
