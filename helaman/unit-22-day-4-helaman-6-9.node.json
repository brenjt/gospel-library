Unfortunately, during this same time the Nephites became wicked and supported the Gadianton robbers, resulting in the Spirit of the Lord being withdrawn from them. The prophet Nephi prophesied that if the Nephites continued to live in wickedness, they would perish. In response, corrupt judges stirred many of the people up to anger against Nephi, while some people boldly defended the prophet. As a testament that his words would be fulfilled, Nephi revealed that the chief judge had been murdered by his brother. When Nephi’s words were verified, some of the people accepted him as a prophet."]],[".topic",{"id":"t15","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/helaman/unit-22-day-4-helaman-6-9.t15"},["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/hel/6"},"Helaman 6"]],["h3","The Lamanites become righteous and fight against the Gadianton robbers, while the Nephites support the secret combinations"],[".figure",["ol.number",["li",["span.label",["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/09410/937456.jpg"}],"1."],["p.para","Draw the following in your scripture study journal, leaving room to write above and below the diagram:"],[".img-left",["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/09410/1057801.gif"}]],["p.para","As you have studied the book of Helaman, you have seen that the Nephites made choices that led the Spirit of the Lord to withdraw from their lives, while the Lamanites made choices that invited the Spirit to increase in their lives.
