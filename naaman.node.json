He came to Elisha at the suggestion of a little Hebrew maid, captured in war (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5.2-3"},"2 Kgs. 5:2–3"],"). He was ordered to bathe seven times in the Jordan, which, after some hesitation, he did and was cured. He showed his gratitude by returning to Samaria, a distance of 30 miles, to thank Elisha. The prophet refused to accept any payment, and his servant Gehazi was punished for taking Naaman’s present.

He did this because he believed that the God of Israel could only be worshipped on Israelite soil."]]],"refs":null}
