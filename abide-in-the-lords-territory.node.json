However, the scriptures refer to the flesh as the physical or carnal nature of the natural man, which allows people to be influenced by passion, desires, appetites, and drives of the flesh instead of looking for inspiration from the Holy Ghost. If we are not careful, those influences together with the pressure of the evil in the world may conduct us to adopt vulgar and reckless behavior which may become part of our character. In order to avoid those bad influences, we have to follow what the Lord instructed the Prophet Joseph Smith about continuously sowing in the Spirit: “Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.33"},"D&C 64:33"],")."],["div",{"id":"p11","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/abide-in-the-lords-territory.p11"},"To enhance our spirit, it is required that we “let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from [us], with all malice” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/eph/4.31"},"Ephesians 4:31"],") and that we “be wise in the days of [our] probation [and] strip [ourselves] of all uncleanness” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.28"},"Mormon 9:28"],")."],["div",{"id":"p12","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/abide-in-the-lords-territory.p12"},"As we study the scriptures, we learn that the promises made by the Lord to us are conditional upon our obedience and encourage righteous living. Those promises must nourish our soul, bringing us hope by encouraging us not to give up even in the face of our daily challenges of living in a world whose ethical and moral values are becoming extinct, thus motivating people to sow in the flesh even more. But how can we be certain that our choices are helping us to sow in the Spirit and not in the flesh?"],["div",{"id":"p13","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/abide-in-the-lords-territory.p13"},"President George Albert Smith, repeating counsel from his grandfather, once said: “There is a line of demarcation well defined between the Lord’s territory and the devil’s territory.

Even in adverse circumstances in life, those who accept the invitation to come unto Christ become a light to the world. A few weeks ago while visiting one of the wards in South Africa, I had the privilege to accompany two young priests, their bishop, and their stake president in a visit to less-active young men of their quorum. I was greatly impressed by the courage and humility that those two priests showed as they invited the less-active young men to return to church. While they talked to those less-active young men, I noticed that their countenances reflected the Savior’s light and at the same time filled with light all those around them. They were fulfilling their duty to “succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/81.5"},"D&C 81:5"],").

The Savior banished from His life any influence that might take His focus away from His divine mission, especially when He was tempted by the enemy or by his followers while He ministered here on earth. Although He never sinned, He had a broken heart and a contrite spirit, full of love for our Heavenly Father and for all men. He humbled Himself before our Father in Heaven, denying His own will to fulfill what the Father had asked of Him in all things until the end. Even at that moment of extreme physical and spiritual pain, carrying the burden of the sins of all mankind on His shoulders and shedding blood through His pores, He told the Father, “Nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/14.36"},"Mark 14:36"],")."],["div",{"id":"p22","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/abide-in-the-lords-territory.p22"},"My prayer, brothers and sisters, as we think about our covenants is that we may keep ourselves strong against “the fiery darts of the adversary” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.24"},"1 Nephi 15:24"],"), following the Savior’s example so that we may sow in the Spirit and abide in the Lord’s territory.
