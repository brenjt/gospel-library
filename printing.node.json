You can print individual outlines by clicking the printer icon in the top right corner of the screen. You can then take multiple outlines to a local printer and have copies made for the teachers in your ward or stake. Because the outlines are updated periodically with new general conference talks and other resources, you should probably print only one to three units of outlines at a time. Consider keeping the outlines in a binder so that teachers can easily replace outlines when they are updated."]]]]]],"refs":null}
