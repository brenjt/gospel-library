The chosen servants and appointed officers in the Church of Jesus Christ are put on earth by Him to conduct the work necessary for the salvation of mankind. A minister “called of God, as was Aaron” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/heb/5.4"},"Heb. 5:4"],"), and endowed with the holy priesthood, represents the Lord when he is performing his official duties and is the Lord’s agent. Therefore, what he does “according to the will of the Lord is the Lord’s business” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.29"},"D&C 64:29"],"). The Lord has given apostles, prophets, evangelists, high priests, seventies, elders, bishops, priests, teachers, deacons, helps, and governments “for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ” (the Church), until all have reached the spiritual stature of Christ, the whole body being “fitly joined together” by that which every part supplieth.
