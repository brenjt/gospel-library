The association of this pagan goddess with the celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ was only by adaptation and synthesis. There is no real connection. Jesus, being the Lamb of God, was crucified at Passover time and is the true Passover (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/1-cor/5.7"},"1 Cor. 5:7"],"). He was raised from the grave on the third day thereafter. It thus became a springtime anniversary and has come to be called Easter in the Christian world."]]],"refs":null}
