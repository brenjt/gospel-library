Previously in the Book of Mormon, both Nephi and King Benjamin acknowledged their use of Egyptian. Nephi stated that he wrote in “the language of the Egyptians” when he engraved the small plates (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.2"},"1 Nephi 1:2"],"). When speaking to his sons about the importance of the brass plates, King Benjamin noted that Lehi could read the record because he had “been taught in the language of the Egyptians” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1.4"},"Mosiah 1:4"],"). Therefore, we understand that Lehi taught both the gospel and the Egyptian language “to his children, that thereby they could teach them to their children” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1.4"},"Mosiah 1:4"],"). Evidently, this pattern continued through the generations of record keepers who followed until Moroni learned the language from his father. However, Moroni acknowledged that he wrote in “reformed Egyptian” that had been “handed down and altered … according to [their] manner of speech” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.32"},"Mormon 9:32"],"), indicating that some adaptations in the use of the language had occurred over the thousand years since the time of Lehi. This could explain why Moroni concluded with the comment that “none other people knoweth our language” but that God had “prepared means for” the eventual interpretation and translation of the record (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.34"},"Mormon 9:34"],"). Egyptian was commonly used in Lehi’s day, especially by merchants and traders who traveled widely throughout the region around Jerusalem. If, as some have suggested, Lehi’s profession required him to travel throughout the region, he likely would have made sure his sons learned the language of the Egyptians to support the family occupation."]]]]]]],"refs":null}
