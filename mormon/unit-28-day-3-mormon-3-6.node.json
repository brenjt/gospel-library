Mormon pled with the Nephites to repent; instead, they boasted in their own strength and swore to avenge their fallen brethren. Because the Lord had forbidden His people to seek revenge, Mormon refused to lead their army, and they were defeated. As the Nephites persisted in wickedness, God poured out His judgments upon them and the Lamanites began to sweep them from the earth. Eventually, Mormon returned to lead the Nephites in battle, but because they refused to repent, they were destroyed by the Lamanites. Mormon lamented their fall and their unwillingness to return to Jesus Christ. He prophesied that the record of the people would come forth in the last days, and he encouraged those who would read it to repent and prepare for their own judgment before God."]],[".topic",{"id":"t10","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/mormon/unit-28-day-3-mormon-3-6.t10"},["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/3"},"Mormon 3–4"]],["h3","Because the Nephites increase in wickedness, Mormon refuses to lead their armies, and the Lamanites begin to sweep the Nephites off the earth"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/mormon/unit-28-day-3-mormon-3-6.p7"},"Have you ever felt that the Lord wanted you to change something in your life?
