In the Old Testament the months are not usually named but simply numbered; they spoke of “the second month” and so on. The later Jews called their months by names they got from Babylon: (1) Nisan, (2) Iyar, (3) Siwan, (4) Tammuz, (5) Ab, (6) Elul, (7) Tishri, (8) Markheshwan, (9) Kislew, (10) Tebeth, (11) Shebat, (12) Adar. To these was added, when necessary, a thirteenth month, called 2nd Adar. With the later Jews the",["i","civil"],"year began on the 1st of Tishri.
