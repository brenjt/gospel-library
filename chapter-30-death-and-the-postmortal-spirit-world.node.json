The students are certain to mention fear of the unknown. Even watching someone die does not remove the element of the unknown: death is, or will be, a unique experience for each person. Much of what we otherwise would not know about death, however, has been revealed through the gospel. President Smith wrote that by having a testimony of the atonement of Jesus Christ and a knowledge of what happens at death, we can have “joy even in death” (",["span.emphasis","Gospel Doctrine,"],"p. 428; or Supporting Statements A on p. 84 of the student manual).
