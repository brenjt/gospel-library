We were in West Africa, a beautiful part of the world where the Church is growing and the Latter-day Saints are delightful. However, West Africa also has many challenges. In particular, I was sorrowed by the poverty that I saw. In the cities there is high unemployment, and families often struggle to provide for their daily needs and for their safety. It broke my heart to know that many of our precious members of the Church live in such deprivation. But I also learned that these fine members help each other to lighten their heavy burdens."],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/ensign/2013/09/april-2013-conference-notebook/a-light-in-africa.p7"},"We eventually arrived at one of our meetinghouses near a large city.
