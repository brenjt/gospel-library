Often referred to as the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord, the Comforter, or simply the Spirit, the Holy Ghost teaches us in a variety of ways. Our scriptures are filled with dramatic examples of visions, dreams, or the appearances of angels as a means of teaching prophets and others. More often, however, the Spirit communicates to us through less dramatic but still powerful ways—promptings; a still, small voice; or a feeling of warmth, peace, and comfort."],["div",{"id":"p3","uri":"/ensign/2013/01/taught-by-the-spirit.p3"},"We see in the scriptures that those who were taught by the Spirit first prepared themselves by opening their heart and mind to receive divine inspiration in their lives. We must do the same as we seek answers to our prayers. Setting aside a time and a quiet place to pray invites the Spirit and allows us to hear and feel His inspiration. We can take an active role in being taught by the Spirit by often exerting ourselves spiritually, mentally, and physically, and then listening for an answer."],["div",{"id":"f1","uri":"/ensign/2013/01/taught-by-the-spirit.f1"},[".caption",["span.emphasis","Abraham and the Three Angels,"],"by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo.
