They will also learn that God desires to bless His children. Lehi and his people experienced God’s mercy and blessings as they followed His commandments. Lehi and Nephi sought guidance from God and received it through dreams, visions, the Liahona, and the guidance of the Holy Ghost. Nephi received and recorded a panoramic vision of earth’s history that showed him the omniscience of God; the baptism, ministry, and crucifixion of Jesus Christ; the destruction of the Nephites; and the latter days. God helped Nephi and his brothers obtain the brass plates so they could have the scriptures. He also saved Lehi and his people from famine in the wilderness and destruction on the ocean, safely delivering them to the promised land. As students study the experiences of Nephi and Lehi in this book, they can learn how to seek and receive the blessings of heaven."]],[".topic",{"id":"t2","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/1-nephi/1-nephi.t2"},["h2","Who wrote this book?"],["p.para",{"id":"p5","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/1-nephi/1-nephi.p5"},"Lehi’s son Nephi wrote this book in response to the Lord’s command that he keep a record of his people. Nephi was likely born in or near Jerusalem. He lived there during the ministry of the prophet Jeremiah and the reign of King Zedekiah. Nephi sought his own witness about his father’s words concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the need for their family to leave. As he continued to seek and follow the counsel of the Lord, Nephi became an instrument in God’s hands. He obediently returned to Jerusalem with his brothers twice—first to obtain the brass plates and later to persuade Ishmael’s family to join Lehi’s family in the wilderness. With the Lord’s help, Nephi built the ship that took his family and others across the ocean to the promised land. When Lehi died, the Lord chose Nephi to be the leader of his people."]],[".topic",{"id":"t3","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/1-nephi/1-nephi.t3"},["h2","To whom was this book written and why?"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/1-nephi/1-nephi.p7"},"Nephi wrote with three audiences in mind: his father’s descendants, the Lord’s covenant people in the last days, and all the people in the world (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.3,13"},"2 Nephi 33:3, 13"],").
