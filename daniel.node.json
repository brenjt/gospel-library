Nothing is known of his parentage, though he appears to have been of royal descent (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/dan/1.3"},"Dan. 1:3"],"); he was taken captive to Babylon and received the name of Belteshazzar (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/dan/1.6-7"},"1:6–7"],"). Along with three others he refused the “king’s meat” from fear of defilement (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/dan/1.8-16"},"1:8–16"],"). He then won the favor of Nebuchadnezzar and Darius by his power of interpreting dreams (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/dan/2,4"},"Dan. 2; 4"],") and the handwriting on the wall (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/dan/5"},"Dan. 5"],").
