But when he arrived at the end of a long trip, he found himself in Kansas City. At first he would not believe it. When he asked for Woodward Avenue and was told there was no Woodward Avenue, he was indignant—he knew there was. It was some time before he could face the fact that in spite of his good intentions and his earnest desire, he was not in Detroit at all but in Kansas City. Everything was fine except for one little detail; he had just caught the wrong bus."],["div",{"id":"p6","uri":"/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-teacher-manual/chapter-33-kingdoms-of-glory-and-perdition.p6"},"“Isn’t it interesting that so many human beings arrive at some port in life where they never intended to go. We pick out goals of honor and success and happiness, and then we sometimes get on the buses that take us to destinations loaded with dishonor, failure, and unpleasantness. A primary purpose of our mortal existence is to prepare for the life that lies beyond. And our possible destination has been separated into three great subdivisons, which Paul compares in desirability to the light of the sun, the moon, and the stars. …"],["div",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-teacher-manual/chapter-33-kingdoms-of-glory-and-perdition.p7"},"“We may have the highest objectives in our hearts, but when we get on that bus that takes us to the wrong destination, we can’t very well change our situation merely by pointing out to ourselves that we had the best of intentions. It will then be the facts that will be important. We are going to be judged by our works, not by our intentions, and it may seem pretty empty then to hear the old cliche that ‘the path to hell is paved with good intentions.’ …"],["div",{"id":"p8","uri":"/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-teacher-manual/chapter-33-kingdoms-of-glory-and-perdition.p8"},"“And so we come back again to this great idea which is one of the most important in the world: first, that we know where we want to go; and second, that we get on the bus that will take us there.” (“On the Wrong Bus,”",["span.emphasis","New Era,"],"July 1983, pp. 4–6.)"]],[".topic",["h2","Ideas for Teaching"],["div",{"id":"f1","uri":"/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-teacher-manual/chapter-33-kingdoms-of-glory-and-perdition.f1"},["ol.alphaCaps",["li",["span.label","A."],[".para","There are three kingdoms, or degrees, of glory, which are compared to the sun, the moon, and the stars."],["div",{"id":"f","uri":"/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-teacher-manual.f"},["ol.content-list alpha-caps",["li",["span.label","■"],[".para","Ask the students to name three persons in the Bible who saw or testified of the degrees of glory."],["ul.noMarker",["li",[".para",["span.emphasis","Jacob (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/gen/28.12-16"},"Genesis 28:12–16"],")."],"“Paul ascended into the third heavens, and he could understand the three principal rounds of Jacob’s ladder—the telestial, the terrestrial, and the celestial glories or kingdoms, where Paul saw and heard things which were not lawful for him to utter” (Joseph Smith,",["span.emphasis","Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,"],"pp. 304–5)."]],["li",[".para",["span.emphasis","Jesus Christ (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/14.1-2"},"John 14:1–2"],"; see also"],"History of the Church,",["span.emphasis","6:365)."],"The Prophet Joseph Smith changed",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/14.2"},"John 14:2"],"to read, “In my Father’s kingdom are many kingdoms.”"]],["li",[".para",["span.emphasis","Paul (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.40-42"},"1 Corinthians 15:40–42"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.1-4"},"2 Corinthians 12:1–4"],")."],"Why is the information in the Bible concerning the degrees of glory so scanty?
