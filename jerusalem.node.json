It lay on the frontier line between Judah and Benjamin and was chosen by David to be his capital. Until then it had been merely a mountain fortress, about 2600 feet above sea level, surrounded by deep valleys on all sides except the north. On the east was the Valley of the Kidron, dividing the Temple Mountain from the Mount of Olives; on the west and south was the Valley of Hinnom. The plateau on which the city stands was originally divided by another valley, called by Josephus the Tyropaean Valley, now in great part filled up with debris.

It may have protected the city on the north, the only side on which it had not the defense of precipitous ravines. During David’s reign the city was little more than a fortress, the king occupying a wooden palace, and the ark still dwelling “in curtains.” During the reign of Solomon much was done toward beautifying the city, the chief buildings erected being the temple (see",["i",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bd/temple-of-solomon"},"Temple of Solomon"]],") and the king’s palace, to which was given the name of “the house of the forest of Lebanon.”"],["div",{"id":"p3","uri":"/scriptures/bd/jerusalem.p3","order":".000.1793"},"After the division of the kingdoms Jerusalem remained the capital of Judah.
