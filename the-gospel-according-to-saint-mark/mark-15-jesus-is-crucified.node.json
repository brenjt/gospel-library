Elder James E. Talmage, who was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, wrote that “death by crucifixion was at once the most lingering and most painful of all forms of execution. The victim lived in ever increasing torture, generally for many hours, sometimes for days. … The welcome relief of death came through the exhaustion caused by intense and unremitting pain” (Jesus the Christ, 655). In",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.16-19"},"Doctrine and Covenants 19:16–19"],", Jesus spoke of the pain He felt in Gethsemane, which seems to have been greater and more intense than His suffering on the cross. As one of our hymns declares: “We may not know, we cannot tell, What pains he had to bear, But we believe it was for us He hung and suffered there” (“There Is a Green Hill Far Away,” Hymns, no. 194). Keep in mind, as you read this chapter, that “it was for [you] he hung and suffered there.”"]],[".bodyBlock",[".",{"id":"f61","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-mark/mark-15-jesus-is-crucified.f61"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-051-2.gif"}]],[".topic",["h2","Other Accounts of What You Read in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/15"},"Mark 15"]],["p.para",{"id":"p373","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-mark/mark-15-jesus-is-crucified.p373"},["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/15.1-19"},"Mark 15:1–19"],"—",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/27.2,11-30"},"Matthew 27:2, 11–30"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/23.1-25"},"Luke 23:1–25"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/18.28"},"John 18:28–19:16"]],["p.para",{"id":"p374","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-mark/mark-15-jesus-is-crucified.p374"},["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/15.20-41"},"Mark 15:20–41"],"—",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/27.31-56"},"Matthew 27:31–56"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/23.26-49"},"Luke 23:26–49"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/19.16-37"},"John 19:16–37"]],["p.para",{"id":"p375","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-mark/mark-15-jesus-is-crucified.p375"},["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/15.42-47"},"Mark 15:42–47"],"—",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/27.57-61"},"Matthew 27:57–61"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/23.50-56"},"Luke 23:50–56"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/19.38-42"},"John 19:38–42"]]],[".topic",["h2","Understanding the Scriptures"],[".figure",{"id":"f62","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-mark/mark-15-jesus-is-crucified.f62"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/15"},"Mark 15"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","Pilate"],"(vv. 1–15)"],["td","The Roman governor in Jerusalem"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Marvelled"],"(vv. 5, 44)"],["td","Wondered"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","That feast"],"(v. 6)"],["td","Passover"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Insurrection"],"(v. 7)"],["td","Rebellion against the government"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Content the people"],"(v. 15)"],["td","Satisfy the people"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Platted"],"(v. 17)"],["td","Twisted together, braided"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Compel"],"(v. 21)"],["td","Forced"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Wine mingled with myrrh"],"(v. 23)"],["td","A mixture that could numb the pain"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Parted his garments"],"(v. 24)"],["td","Divided up his clothes"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Casting lots upon them"],"(v. 24)"],["td","Playing games of chance to see who got them"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","The superscription of his accusation"],"(v. 26)"],["td","What was written about the crime he was charged with"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Railed on him"],"(v. 29)"],["td","Mocked him"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Reviled"],"(v. 32)"],["td","Insulted"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Even"],"(v. 42)"],["td","Evening"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Sepulchre"],"(v. 46)"],["td","Tomb, place to bury the dead"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Hewn"],"(v. 46)"],["td","Cut"],["td"]]]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/15.34"},"Mark 15:34"],"—“My God, My God, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?”"],["p.para",{"id":"p392","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-mark/mark-15-jesus-is-crucified.p392"},"These words are also found in the Messianic prophecy of",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/ps/22.1"},"Psalm 22:1"],".
