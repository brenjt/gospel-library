And, indeed, play is one of the first ways children learn to use their bodies. Families can help little ones by spending time helping them to both identify body parts and to learn how the body and its parts can move. It is essential for a healthy, growing child to feel good about his body. This activity gives young children problem-solving experiences as they try to place different parts of their body on a carpet square, newspaper, reed mat, or other kind of mat. Teenagers and adults can also join in to get a workout, as well as to have fun."],[".topic",["h2","Preparation"],["div",{"id":"p4","uri":"/manual/family-home-evening-resource-book/family-activities/carpet-square-challenge.p4"},"Get a carpet sample, reed mat, hand towel, or something similar for each family member. Choose a space inside or outside where each person can move on and around his carpet sample without bumping into anyone. Prepare in advance a lengthy list of movement challenges (see sample list) to verbally give to participants. Start with simple problems and gradually increase the difficulty."]],[".topic",["h2","Activity"],["div",{"id":"p6","uri":"/manual/family-home-evening-resource-book/family-activities/carpet-square-challenge.p6"},"Have each family member find his own space and position himself with his carpet square on the floor or grass. Have the family member leading the activity call out body parts to be placed on the carpet sample. By calling out opposites such as front—back, bottom—stomach, right hip—left hip, the leader can intensify the physical activity. By calling out body parts quickly one after another, this activity can turn into a vigorous game. The leader can also call out two body parts to be put on the carpet square at the same time. Giving each family member a chance to be the leader helps them learn body parts and allows them to observe the many different ways family members may be solving problems."],["div",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/family-home-evening-resource-book/family-activities/carpet-square-challenge.p7"},"Try to challenge the problem-solving abilities of family members.
