Figure out the approximate dimensions of the parts of the sculpture. For best results, use snow that is wet or packed in compact drifts and shape it into dense balls, squares, or related forms. Use a knife, spatula, shovel, hoe, wood scraper, or other tool to carve the packed snow. This will keep your hands from getting too cold. Add snow as required to give proper form."],["div",{"id":"p5","uri":"/manual/family-home-evening-resource-book/family-activities/making-snow-sculptures.p5"},"Add color to your snow sculpture by dissolving food coloring or clothing dye in water and painting it on the sculpture or mixing it with the snow. Spray water, using a clothes spray or garden spray. Brushing on water with a paint brush can add a nice glaze to your object. Try an igloo, snowman statue, dog, cat, spaceship, or nativity scene for starters."]],[".topic",["h2","Additional Activities"],["div",{"id":"f83","uri":"/manual/family-home-evening-resource-book/family-activities/making-snow-sculptures.f83"},["ol.number",["li",["span.label","1."],[".para","Have a family contest and award prizes for form, style, creativity, or color.
