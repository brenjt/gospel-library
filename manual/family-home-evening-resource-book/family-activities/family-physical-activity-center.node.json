First, find a small area, outdoors or indoors, which you might use. Visit a park, school playground, health spa, or athletic club for ideas. Consider equipment that will help family members work on balance, flexibility, strength, coordination, and endurance. Include items for the ages of your family members. Try to find inexpensive ways to build your center. You probably won’t need everything listed below. A few versatile items may be all you can afford and all you have room for.
