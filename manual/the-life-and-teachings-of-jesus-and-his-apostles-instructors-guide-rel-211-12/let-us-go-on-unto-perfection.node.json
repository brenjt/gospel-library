He therefore concluded that the gospel was a higher law. Then he tied this to the doctrines of perfection, showing the need of the Melchizedek Priesthood in the pursuit of perfection. The instructor will be interested in calling attention to Paul’s problems with the Hebrew saints, who wanted to keep many of the practices of the law of Moses; but he also will wish to carry this lesson into the lives of his students. One way he can do this is by a chalkboard discussion in which he would write Aaronic Priesthood at the head of one column and Melchizedek Priesthood at the head of another. Then he could encourage his class to name the powers and functions that belong to each of these priesthoods. He would emphasize, of course, that the Melchizedek Priesthood embraces or includes all of the functions and powers of the Aaronic Priesthood. After discussing the chalkboard priesthood-level chart, the teacher could show how the law of Moses included some of the same items that appeared on the Aaronic Priesthood list. Then other characteristics of the law of Moses could be discussed. The final outcome of this discussion would be to point out (1) the foolishness of the Jews in clinging to the law of Moses, and (2) the wisdom of young people when they seek the greater blessings of the Melchizedek Priesthood. This could be followed by a reading of",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/abr/1.1-4"},"Abraham 1:1-4"],".
