To exercise faith in another is to trust him, to have confidence in his ability to do what he says he will do, to believe enough in what he says to act upon it. The opposite of faith is fear and doubt. Men who doubt that God knows all things when he says he does, doubt God’s own word on the matter. They cannot, therefore, act in faith on that word. As defined in scripture, faith is the foundation of hope. It is trusting in the truth of unseen things and the substance of our earnest expectations. It becomes a major reason why we engage ourselves in the work of the Lord. Exceeding faith in Christ brings forgiveness and greater faith; calling upon God in faith brings power to withstand every temptation. Thus, by faith men “lay hold upon every good gift.” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.30"},"Moroni 10:30"],".) It is this fact that makes faith the first principle of the gospel. It is not first only in the sense that it precedes all action; it is first in importance as well.

What is faith? How does it work? Do you have total faith? When we come to a full and total understanding of faith, then I think we ought to move on to repentance. When we understand that totally, then we should move through the principles. But I doubt we will ever really get through an understanding and complete knowledge of faith in a lifetime. I don’t care how intellectual you are, or how long you study, I doubt you will ever come to an end of the study of faith, the first principle of the gospel.’ (“As If They Would Ask Him to Tarry a Little Longer,”",["span.emphasis","BYU Speeches of the Year,"],"1975, p. 375.)"]]]]],"refs":null}
