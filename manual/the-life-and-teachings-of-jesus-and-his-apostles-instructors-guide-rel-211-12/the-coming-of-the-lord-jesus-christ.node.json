Too many times young people hear only the negative aspects of prophecies that relate to this great event. It is hoped that when they have finished this discussion they will realize that the Lord has made great promises to those who will follow the prophets. Perhaps a chalkboard discussion could be held on the promises the Lord has made to the righteous. Also, this lesson is not just a lesson on the Second Coming, but a lesson on Paul’s teachings from 1 and 2 Thessalonians on the Second Coming. Also note that lesson 22 is on the Second Coming.
