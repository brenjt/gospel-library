The answer could be achieved through the use of scriptural analysis. Using John 13:4-17, the washing of the apostles feet, and Matthew 26:26-29, the institution of the sacrament, the class could focus on acts of service Christ rendered during the Last Supper as a type of his whole ministry. The class would be analyzing the scriptures to find answers to the posed question. Among other answers, two are important: (1) the Savior set the example as to how we are to serve, and (2) his service was to assist others in becoming like him."]],[".topic",["h3","To Give Christlike Service, One Must Be Striving to Live a Christlike life"],["div",{"id":"p50","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles-instructors-guide-rel-211-12/as-i-have-loved-you.p50"},"To assist the class in gaining the concept that one cannot render Christlike service unless he indeed is striving to become as the Savior, the instructor could ask one of his students to give another student that which neither of them have.

At another time, the teacher may wish to ask a student to give another a pen with green ink. (Almost anything will do, provided the student does not have the item.) When the student states he cannot give what he does not have, the point can be made that one cannot render Christlike service unless he is striving to become like our Savior.
