For example, when asked about credentials for modern prophets, the teacher may respond with a question: Did Jesus expect the Jews of Peter’s day to accept Peter as the Lord’s agent with no more witness than that of the Spirit in the heart and mind? (See",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.16-21"},"2 Peter 1:16-21"],".) Why did people reject Jesus? (See",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/3.18-21"},"John 3:18-21"],".)

For instance, Elder Ezra Taft Benson tells how his father read his family the instruction of the First Presidency to have family home evening and announced, “The Presidency has spoken, and this is the word of the Lord to us!” (“Timely Counsel,” Solemn Assembly, Cardston, Alberta, Canada, 2 Aug. 1975. Used by permission.) It became a family tradition to hold family home evening. Has this meant anything to the Benson family?"]]]]],"refs":null}
