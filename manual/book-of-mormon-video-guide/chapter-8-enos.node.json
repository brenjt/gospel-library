The Spirit bears witness concerning gospel truths, provides answers to prayer, and teaches how to live. Some young people, however, are spiritually stagnant and are not motivated to seek spiritual growth until a tragedy or a crisis occurs in their lives. Others are content to wait until they leave home for schooling or a mission before they pursue spiritual experiences. But students need not wait. If they have an appropriate level of worthiness, the process of pondering and mighty prayer that Enos identified can enable them to enjoy greater blessings of spirituality almost immediately."]]],[".topic",["h2","Using the Video"],[".subtitle","“And My Soul Hungered” 10:20"],[".topic",["h3","“Look For” Activity"],["div",{"id":"p3","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-video-guide/chapter-8-enos.p3"},"Suggest that the students identify Jared’s motivation and how he sought spiritual growth."]],[".topic",["h3","Show the Video"],["div",{"id":"p4","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-video-guide/chapter-8-enos.p4"},"The video portrays a modern-day parallel to the story of Enos.
