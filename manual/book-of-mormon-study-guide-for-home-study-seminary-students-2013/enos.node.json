Enos wrestled before God in mighty prayer before his sins were forgiven. He then prayed for the spiritual welfare of the Nephites and Lamanites. He spent the remainder of his life laboring for their salvation. As you study the book of Enos, you can discover important lessons about prayer, repentance, and revelation. You can also learn that as individuals receive the blessings of the Atonement, they will desire to share those blessings with others."]],[".topic",{"id":"t2","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/enos/enos.t2"},["h2","Who Wrote This Book?"],["p.para",{"id":"p5","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/enos/enos.p5"},"Enos, the son of Jacob and the grandson of Lehi and Sariah, authored this book.
