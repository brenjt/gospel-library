Jacob repeatedly testified of the Savior and invited his people and those who would read his words to repent. He taught and demonstrated the importance of diligently fulfilling callings from the Lord. He warned his people against the dangers of pride, riches, and immorality. Jacob also quoted and commented on Zenos’s allegory of the olive trees, which illustrates the Savior’s tireless efforts to bring about the salvation of all God’s children. In his encounter with Sherem, an anti-Christ, Jacob demonstrated how to righteously respond to those who question or criticize our faith."]],[".topic",{"id":"t2","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/jacob/jacob.t2"},["h2","Who Wrote This Book?"],["p.para",{"id":"p5","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/jacob/jacob.p5"},"Jacob, the fifth son of Sariah and Lehi, wrote this book.

Nephi consecrated Jacob to be a priest and teacher of the Nephites (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.26"},"2 Nephi 5:26"],") and later entrusted him with the small plates of Nephi (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1.1-4"},"Jacob 1:1–4"],"). As a faithful priesthood leader and teacher, Jacob labored diligently to persuade his people to believe in Christ (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1.7"},"Jacob 1:7"],"). He received revelations concerning the Savior, experienced the ministering of angels and heard the voice of the Lord (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7.5"},"Jacob 7:5"],"), and saw his Redeemer (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.2-3"},"2 Nephi 11:2–3"],").
