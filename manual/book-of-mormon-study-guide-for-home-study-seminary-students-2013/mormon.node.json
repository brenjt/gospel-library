He also made “a full account” of events from his lifetime upon the large plates of Nephi. (See",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/2.18"},"Mormon 2:18"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/5.9"},"5:9"],".) When Mormon was “about ten years of age,” the record keeper Ammaron informed him that eventually he would have the responsibility to record “all the things that [he] observed concerning this people” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/1.2,4"},"Mormon 1:2, 4"],"). At about age 24, he gained custody of the plates of Nephi and made “a record according to the words of Ammaron” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/2.17"},"Mormon 2:17"],"). Later, Mormon began abridging the large plates of Nephi, which included writings from prophets and record keepers from Lehi through Ammaron. Near the end of his life, Mormon “hid up in the hill Cumorah all the records which had been entrusted to [him] by the hand of the Lord,” except for a few plates that he gave to his son Moroni (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/6.6"},"Mormon 6:6"],"). He then led the Nephites in their last great battle against the Lamanites. Before Mormon died, he directed Moroni to complete his record. Moroni added the writings comprising chapters 8–9 of this book."]],[".topic",{"id":"t3","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/mormon/mormon.t3"},["h2","When and Where Was It Written?"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/mormon/mormon.p7"},"Mormon likely wrote",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/1"},"Mormon 1–7"],"between",["span.small","A.D."],"345 and",["span.small","A.D."],"401 (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/2.15-17"},"Mormon 2:15–17"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.5-6"},"8:5–6"],").
