The book is named for Helaman, the son of Helaman and grandson of Alma the Younger. Helaman received the records from his uncle, Shiblon, and served as a righteous chief judge over the Nephites. He taught his sons Nephi and Lehi to remember their Redeemer, Jesus Christ (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.9-14"},"Helaman 5:9–14"],"). These teachings later inspired Nephi to give up his position as chief judge in order to preach repentance to the Nephites and Lamanites. After thousands of Lamanites were converted, a Lamanite prophet named Samuel was inspired to preach repentance and prophesy among the Nephites at the same time as Nephi. The book of Helaman draws from the records kept during the governing and ministry of Helaman (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/hel/1"},"Helaman 1–3"],") and Nephi (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/hel/4"},"Helaman 4–16"],").
