Ammon discovered the descendants of Zeniff’s people, who were now led by Zeniff’s grandson Limhi. Ammon’s arrival brought hope to Limhi and his people, whose iniquities had allowed them to be placed in bondage to the Lamanites. Earlier, while attempting to find Zarahemla and ask for help, a group of Limhi’s people found 24 gold plates with engravings on them. When Limhi asked Ammon if he could translate the engravings, Ammon explained that a seer, like King Mosiah, could translate the ancient records."]],[".topic",{"id":"t23","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/mosiah/unit-12-day-1-mosiah-7-8.t23"},["h2","Overview of",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/7"},"Mosiah 7–24"]],["p.para",{"id":"p6","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/mosiah/unit-12-day-1-mosiah-7-8.p6"},"Have you ever wanted to be delivered from bad feelings, a painful situation, a challenging or oppressive circumstance, or guilt from sin?
