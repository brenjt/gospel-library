Both groups prayed mightily to be released from bondage. While both groups of people were eventually delivered and arrived in Zarahemla, the Lord helped each group in different ways. From studying the trials and deliverance of Limhi’s group, you can see the Lord will answer our prayers in His own way and time as we humble ourselves.

The other reason for adversity is to accomplish the Lord’s own purposes in our life that we may receive the refinement that comes from testing.
