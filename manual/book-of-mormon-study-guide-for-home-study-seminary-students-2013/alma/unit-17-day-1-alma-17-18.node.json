These accounts provide an example of how missionaries today should prepare and serve. The sons of Mosiah sought the Lord’s guidance as they prepared to preach the gospel to the Lamanites. As they went their separate ways, the Lord comforted them and promised they would bring souls unto Him. Ammon went to the land of Ishmael and began to teach by serving a Lamanite king named Lamoni. King Lamoni marveled at Ammon’s power when he defended the king’s flocks. This service softened the hearts of the king and his people to hear Ammon’s teachings about God and the plan of salvation. King Lamoni believed what Ammon taught, recognized his need for a Savior, cried unto the Lord for mercy, and was overcome by the Spirit."]],[".topic",{"id":"t40","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-17-day-1-alma-17-18.t40"},["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.1-18"},"Alma 17:1–18"]],["h3","The sons of Mosiah prepare to preach the gospel to the Lamanites"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-17-day-1-alma-17-18.p7"},"Think about the length of time elders and sisters serve on their missions today.
