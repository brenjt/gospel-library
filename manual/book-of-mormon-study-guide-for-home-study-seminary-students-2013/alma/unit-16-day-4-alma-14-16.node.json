Others were angry and caused Alma and Amulek to be imprisoned. The wicked people in Ammonihah cast out the men who believed and burned their wives and children. After many days, the Lord delivered Alma and Amulek from prison and destroyed the wicked leaders of Ammonihah. In Sidom, Zeezrom was suffering physically and spiritually. He professed his faith in Jesus Christ to Alma and was healed. In fulfillment of prophecy, a Lamanite army destroyed the city of Ammonihah. Alma’s prophetic guidance allowed the Nephite armies to stop the Lamanites’ aggression. Alma, Amulek, and many others strengthened the Church throughout the land of the Nephites."],[".image",{"id":"f87","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-16-day-4-alma-14-16.f87"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/09410/154099.jpg"}]]],[".topic",{"id":"t37","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-16-day-4-alma-14-16.t37"},["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/14"},"Alma 14"]],["h3","Alma and Amulek are imprisoned and the believers are cast out or burned"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/alma/unit-16-day-4-alma-14-16.p7"},"Think of an instance when you may have seen or heard about someone who was innocent suffer at the hands of another person—an incident of someone being persecuted for his or her beliefs, for example.
