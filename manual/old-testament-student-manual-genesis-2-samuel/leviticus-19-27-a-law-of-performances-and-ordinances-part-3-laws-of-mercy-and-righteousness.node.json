These ethics are the heart not only of Leviticus, but also of the entire Old and New Testaments. Recorded here for the first time is the revelation of the one principle that governed all the laws dealing with proper social relationships: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19.18"},"Leviticus 19:18"],"). Thus viewed, it is easy to see that all the other laws were merely the application of the law of love under various circumstances. This law, being both timeless and of universal application, is the seamless fabric on which not only the Old and New Testaments are richly embroidered but our own modern scriptures as well."],[".sidebar box-decor box-right",{"id":"f1","uri":"/manual/old-testament-student-manual-genesis-2-samuel/leviticus-19-27-a-law-of-performances-and-ordinances-part-3-laws-of-mercy-and-righteousness.f1"},["h3","Instructions to Students"],[".figure",{"id":"f2","uri":"/manual/old-testament-student-manual-genesis-2-samuel/leviticus-19-27-a-law-of-performances-and-ordinances-part-3-laws-of-mercy-and-righteousness.f2"},["ol.number",["li",["span.label","1."],["p.para","Use Notes and Commentary below to help you as you read and study",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19"},"Leviticus 19–27"],"."]],["li",["span.label","2."],["p.para","Complete Points to Ponder as directed by your teacher.

The closing chapters of Leviticus focus on laws that defined how one under the Mosaic law lived righteously and in a manner pleasing to God. Leviticus ends with essentially the same message with which it began, namely, the all-important admonition that men are to be holy, even as God is holy. The laws that follow this commandment may seem at first to be without logical arrangement or interconnection, but they are unified when one considers them in light of the injunction to be holy given in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19.2"},"verse 2"],". Note also the strong relationship to the Ten Commandments in what immediately follows (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19.3-12"},"vv. 3–12"],"). The fifth commandment (honoring parents) and the fourth commandment (keeping the Sabbath day holy) are joined in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19.3"},"verse 3"],", followed immediately by the second commandment (no graven images). In",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19.11"},"verse 11"],"the eighth commandment (stealing) is joined with the ninth (bearing false witness), and then again is immediately connected to the third commandment (taking God’s name in vain) in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19.12"},"verse 12"],". By this means the Lord seems to indicate that what follows the commandment to be holy is directly related to these fundamental principles of righteousness. The specific laws that follow the commandments define principles of righteousness that follow naturally from the Ten Commandments. For example, the commandment is not to steal, but these laws show that the commandment means far more than not robbing a man or burglarizing his home. One can steal through fraud or by withholding wages from a laborer (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19.13"},"v. 13"],"). The commandment is to honor one’s parents, but here the Lord used the word “fear” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19.3"},"v. 3"],"), which connotes a deep respect, reverence, and awe, the same feelings one should have for God Himself. The example of the gossiping “talebearer” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19.16"},"v. 16"],") shows that there are ways to bear false witness other than under oath in court. And the concluding principle summarizes the whole purpose of the law. If one is truly holy, as God is holy, then he will love his neighbor as himself (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19.18"},"v. 18"],")."]],[".topic",["h3","(16-3)",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19.18"},"Leviticus 19:18"],".

The wording of the second commandment is instructive. The statement that one is to love his neighbor as himself moves the idea of love in this case from a state of emotion to one of will. Love is that emotion which one naturally feels for oneself. Simply expressed, it is a desire one has for his own good. To love or care for oneself is natural and good, but in addition, one must feel this same emotion for others. Each must desire the good of others as well as his own. This desire is not innate but comes through a conscious act of will or agency. The commandment thus implies that one should work both for his own good and the good of others. He should not aggrandize himself at another’s expense. This commandment is at the heart of all social interaction and becomes the standard by which every act can be judged."],["p.para",{"id":"p16","uri":"/manual/old-testament-student-manual-genesis-2-samuel/leviticus-19-27-a-law-of-performances-and-ordinances-part-3-laws-of-mercy-and-righteousness.p16"},"Any person who truly understands the implications for daily living that are part of the commandment to love God with all his heart, might, mind, and strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, can function well with no additional laws. One does not need to warn a person who loves God properly about idolatry, for any act of worship not devoted to God would be naturally offensive to him. The prohibitions against stealing, adultery, murder, and so on are not required if a person truly loves his neighbor as himself, for to injure his neighbor in such ways would be unthinkable. But, of course, the vast majority of men fail to understand and keep these two commandments, and so the Lord has revealed many additional laws and rules to show specifically what the commandments require. But truly, all such commandments do nothing more than define and support the two basic principles: all the law and the prophets are summarized in the two great commandments."]],[".topic",["h3","(16-4)",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/lev/19.23-25"},"Leviticus 19:23–25"],".
