And the Christ depicted in the book of Revelation, who is shown with the great sickle ready to reap the grapes of the earth and tread them in the winepress (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/rev/14.14,20"},"Revelation 14:14, 20"],"), is the same God of the Old Testament who said to Micah, “What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/ot/micah/6.8"},"Micah 6:8"],")."],["p.para",{"id":"p58","uri":"/manual/old-testament-student-manual-genesis-2-samuel/enrichment-section-a-who-is-the-god-of-the-old-testament.p58"},"There is no inconsistency in the nature of God. He is always perfectly merciful and loving, but He is also perfectly just and will not “look upon sin with the least degree of allowance” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.31"},"D&C 1:31"],"). As He said to Joseph Smith, “God doth not walk in crooked paths, neither doth he turn to the right hand nor to the left, … his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.2"},"D&C 3:2"],"). In the Old Testament is the same perfectly consistent God found in all scripture. In the Old Testament great richness is added to the understanding of God and how He deals with His children, blessing them according to their obedience and receptivity, or punishing them for rebellion and wickedness. If one would get to know Christ better, one must study the Old Testament, for in His role as Jehovah He permeates the whole record. Jesus Christ is the God of the Old Testament just as He is the God of the earth today. Keeping this important fact constantly in mind is one of the keys to understanding both the Old Testament and the nature of God."]]]]]],"refs":null}
