This promised Zion always seems to be a little beyond our reach. We need to understand that as much virtue can be gained in progressing toward Zion as in dwelling there. It is a process as well as a destination. We approach or withdraw from Zion through the manner in which we conduct our daily dealings, how we live within our families, whether we pay an honest tithe and generous fast offering, how we seize opportunities to serve and do so diligently. Many are perfected upon the road to Zion who will never see the city in mortality” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1986, p. 38; or",["span.emphasis","Ensign,"],"May 1986, p. 30)."],[".para","If you did not discuss the theme of Zion in the previous lesson, read",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.9-10"},"Doctrine and Covenants 105:9–10"],"and teach and testify that Zion will yet be a reality.
