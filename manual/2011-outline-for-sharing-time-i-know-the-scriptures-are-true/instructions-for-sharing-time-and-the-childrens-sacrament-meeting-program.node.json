As you prayerfully read the scriptures and apply the principles taught in them and in this outline, you will be spiritually prepared to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ to the children in your Primary. You will also be able to use the scriptures to help the children understand gospel principles you will teach this year, such as Heavenly Father’s plan, the mission of Jesus Christ, the role of prophets, the Restoration of the Church, and the blessings of the temple. The scriptures will help you invite the Spirit into your Primary and create an environment in which the children can feel the influence of the Holy Ghost. That influence will help every Primary child be able to say, “I know the scriptures are true.”"],["div",{"id":"p4","uri":"/manual/2011-outline-for-sharing-time-i-know-the-scriptures-are-true/instructions-for-sharing-time-and-the-childrens-sacrament-meeting-program.p4"},"Thank you for your faithful service.
