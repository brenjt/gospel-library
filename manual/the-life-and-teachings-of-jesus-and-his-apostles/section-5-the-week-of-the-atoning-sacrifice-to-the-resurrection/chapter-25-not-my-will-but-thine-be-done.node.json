Following this “last supper,” Jesus indicated who his betrayer was; Judas then left to carry out his treachery. After signifying his death, Jesus instituted the Lord’s Supper—the sacrament—and said to the eleven apostles, “I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/14.25"},"Mark 14:25"],".) He then said that it was necessary for him to leave them, that he might prepare a place for them with his Father, but that he would send the Comforter to them, and that he himself would come to them. He then left his peace with them, telling them not to be troubled or afraid. Following this discourse (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/14"},"John 14"],"), Jesus said, “Arise, let us go hence.” A hymn was then sung (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/14.26"},"Mark 14:26"],"), and Jesus led the eleven apostles to the Mount of Olives."],["p.para",{"id":"p20","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-5-the-week-of-the-atoning-sacrifice-to-the-resurrection/chapter-25-not-my-will-but-thine-be-done.p20"},"The quiet procession passed through the gate west of the temple, descended into a ravine called Kidron, and then proceeded up the slope of the Mount of Olives. At this time Jesus explained in another discourse to the apostles his relationship to them, and he likened this relationship to a vine and its branches. Jesus commanded the disciples to love one another; then he gave a further explanation of the role of the Comforter and explained why it was necessary that he leave. He spoke plainly concerning his death, which caused the apostles to declare, “Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and … no proverb. … we",["span.emphasis","believe"],"that thou camest forth from God.” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/16.29,30"},"John 16:29, 30"],".) Jesus then offered his great intercessory prayer to the Father on behalf of his disciples (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/17"},"John 17"],"); and, descending the Mount, he took his apostles into a garden called Gethsemane where he subsequently began to pray, and being in great agony he bled at every pore.

The high priest’s role was that of a mediator, or one who interceded with the Lord in behalf of the people.
