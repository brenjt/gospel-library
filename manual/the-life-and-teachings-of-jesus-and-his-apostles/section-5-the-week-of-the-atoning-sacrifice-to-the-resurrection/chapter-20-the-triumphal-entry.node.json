Jerusalem was in an uproar. It was the season of the Passover, and everywhere in the city travelers arrived, lambs and pigeons for offerings were sold, and sacrificial coins clattered in the coffers of those who had perverted the stewardship of caring for Israel. Above the festive clamor for religious merchandise, Jerusalem reverberated with concern about the “Prophet of Galilee.” Among the common people and on the lips of staunch Pharisees was ever the same question: “What think ye, that he will not come to the feast [of the Passover]?” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/11.56"},"John 11:56"],".) Many in Jerusalem must have been awed by the majesty of the drama played before them, the full significance of which they did not perceive. This commemoration of God’s blessing to ancient Israel would be the last authorized Passover—the killing of paschal lambs after this year would be apostasy. For even now, as the bleating of young lambs echoed amidst the confusion of Jerusalem’s din, another great and last sacrifice, “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/rev/13.8"},"Revelation 13:8"],"), was receiving an anointing under Mary’s hand in the quiet of Simon’s house at Bethany."],["p.para",{"id":"p50","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-5-the-week-of-the-atoning-sacrifice-to-the-resurrection/chapter-20-the-triumphal-entry.p50"},"Jerusalem was a natural fortress.

From his record we learn that more than a million Jews lost their lives through the famine incident to the siege; many more were sold into slavery, and uncounted numbers were forced into exile.

Jesus explained by citing a striking illustration drawn from nature: ‘Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.’ The simile is an apt one, and at once impressively simple and beautiful. A farmer who neglects or refuses to cast his wheat into the earth, because he wants to keep it, can have no increase; but if he sow the wheat in good rich soil, each living grain may multiply itself many fold, though of necessity the seed must be sacrificed in the process. So, said the Lord, ‘He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.’ The Master’s meaning is clear; he that loves his life so well that he will not imperil it, or, if need be, give it up, in the service of God, shall forfeit his opportunity to win the bounteous increase of eternal life; while he who esteems the call of God as so greatly superior to life that his love of life is as hatred in comparison, shall find the life he freely yields or is willing to yield, though for the time being it disappear like the grain buried in the soil; and he shall rejoice in the bounty of eternal development. If such be true of every man’s existence, how transcendently so was it of the life of Him who came to die that men may live? Therefore was it necessary that He die, as He had said He was about to do; but His death, far from being life lost, was to be life glorified.” (Talmage,",["span.emphasis","Jesus the Christ,"],"pp. 518–19.)"]],[".topic",["h4","(20-6)",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/12.26"},"John 12:26"],".
