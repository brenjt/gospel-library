Because he had appealed his cause to Caesar, Paul was placed under the custody of a centurion and sent on his way from Caesarea to Rome. He was put aboard a ship with some other prisoners and sailed north to Sidon and finally on to Myra in Lycia. At Myra the centurion, who treated Paul with great respect, secured passage for his company in a boat bound for Italy, which immediately put to sea in hopes of reaching Syracuse in Sicilia before the lateness of the season and the attendant storms would prevent progress. But the storms came as Paul had prophesied, and drove them for many days. Finally the boat was dashed upon the shores of Melita, without the loss of life, again as Paul had prophesied. That was Paul’s fourth shipwreck. But neither this peril nor any other could dissuade him from his ministry or from his witness of the risen Lord. After the winter season had passed, the centurion brought his wards into an Egyptian grain ship bound for Italy. Without incident, they arrived at Puteoli, and from there, via the Appian Way, to Rome. At Rome Paul was subjected only to house arrest and was afforded great liberty, which he used to advantage, preaching and writing: preaching in “the palace, and in all other places” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/philip/1.13"},"Philippians 1:13"],"); writing to the Philippians, the Colossians, the Ephesians, to Philemon, and probably to many others."],["p.para",{"id":"p41","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-9-pauls-witness-from-prison/chapter-43-ye-are---fellow-citizens-with-the-saints.p41"},"Our subject in this chapter is what Paul wrote to the Ephesians of the necessity for a church of unity, and the obligation of saints to bear one another’s burdens, to extend the hand of fellowship, and to be as one."],["p.para",{"id":"p42","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-9-pauls-witness-from-prison/chapter-43-ye-are---fellow-citizens-with-the-saints.p42"},["span.emphasis","Before proceeding, read all the scriptural references in the reading block."]]],[".topic",["h2","Interpretive Commentary"],[".topic",["h3","Ephesians"],[".topic",["h4","(43-1) What Is the Theme of Paul’s Letter to the Ephesians?"],["p.para",{"id":"p46","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-9-pauls-witness-from-prison/chapter-43-ye-are---fellow-citizens-with-the-saints.p46"},"Determining a Theme in this letter is difficult.
