Many have wondered if it was possible that John himself was not sure of Christ’s identity and divine calling. However, we must remember that John’s last recorded testimony was to his disciples when they were concerned about the growing popularity of Jesus. John reminded them that he himself was not the Messiah, and that they should leave him and follow Jesus. That was several months prior to the present event under discussion. It appears that one of the difficulties experienced by John was successfully persuading his disciples to forsake him and become the disciples of Jesus Christ, of whom he had borne witness. Now, months after the baptism of Jesus and after John’s repeated efforts to persuade them, John found some of his disciples still reluctant to detach themselves from him and to follow their true Master. It seems most consistent to identify John’s motive in sending the two disciples to Jesus as one of persuasion for them, rather than of reassurance for himself.",["span.emphasis","The question they were to put to Jesus was for their edification, not for his own."],"John knew, as no one else knew, who Jesus was, and he had known it for a long time. He had had revelation from heaven to this effect: he had seen with his eyes, he had heard with his ears, and he had the testimony of the Holy Ghost. He even had received the ministry of angels while in the prison. The most satisfactory answer seems to be that John sent his disciples to question Jesus about his identity so that they themselves would at long last realize the truth of what John had been testifying for these many months. This approach seems consistent with John’s sure knowledge of the Redeemer, his known testimony to his disciples, and the natural reluctance of his disciples to leave him."],["p.para",{"id":"p54","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-3-the-second-year-of-jesus-public-ministry/chapter-9-whosoever-shall-do-the-will-of-the-father.p54"},"“Perhaps a point should be made here that there was not an antagonism between Jesus and John.
