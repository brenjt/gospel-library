The new birth takes place only for those who actually enjoy the gift or companionship of the Holy Ghost, only for those who are fully converted, who have given themselves without restraint to the Lord. Thus Alma addressed himself to his ‘brethren of the church,’ and pointedly asked them if they had ‘spiritually been born of God,’ received the Lord’s image in their countenances, and had the ‘mighty change’ in their hearts which always attends the birth of the Spirit.

There had been nothing spectacular—no visions, no outward manifestations—but just gradual change. First they had begun to attend church. Later David’s father had announced at the dinner table that they would never eat another meal in their home without having a blessing on the food. That had been twelve years ago. Then they had commenced holding a regular home evening. David still remembered the family journey to the Los Angeles Temple, where they had been sealed together as a family for time and eternity. Later, when David and his brothers had spoken harshly about one of the leaders of their ward, he remembered his father’s justified anger and instant rebuke, for although David’s father had controlled his temper, he made it very clear to his sons that they must never say such things about any of the Church officers again. While his father’s change had occurred quietly and gradually, it was nevertheless a powerful change. David had often wondered to himself what possibly could have taken a hard-headed man like his father and literally turned him around.

As a contrast to twelve years ago, their home was now truly a house of love, prayer, and order. David had listened to his father’s testimony in conferences and as he had shared it with his sons and with others who had been in their home. During one home evening, he had told his sons: “I am not the father you used to have; I have been changed. And I want you to know that for whatever else I may say or do, I know that Jesus lives and is my Redeemer, because I have tasted of his goodness and I know of his love for me.” David knew his father well enough to know that he testified of the reality of Jesus and of the truth of the gospel from the depths of his soul.
