Our saints know peace acceptance. We live in an age when the Church is earning great respect in the world. When we ask ourselves, “Am I faithful enough to die for the Savior?” it is, for the most part, a theoretical possibility. To those of John’s time it was reality. They knew the wrath of a government intent on enforcing the policy of emperor worship. They knew the clutch of fear at the approaching sound of Roman legionaires. By the time of Patmos, according to the traditions that have come down to us, Peter had been crucified, Paul beheaded, Bartholomew skinned alive, Thomas and Matthew run through with spears. John was the only surviving apostle; all the others had died violently because of their faith.

It was a revelation of himself to the saints of God in one of the blackest moments of the church’s history. We who enjoy the comfort and peace of the twentieth century cannot fully fathom the comfort and courage that must have come from Patmos. We think of the book of Revelation as a mysterious, baffling work.

Moreover, his ecclesiastical position as an apostle would have given him the authority to address these churches in the manner in which he did. Sir William Ramsay, a renowned scholar of New Testament geography, once noted that all seven of the cities to whom John addressed the revelation lay on a great circular road that anciently ran through Asia. If one were to start at Ephesus and travel to the others in the order in which they were named, he would travel along this circular route."],["p.para",{"id":"p59","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-12-johns-witness-of-the-church-triumphant/chapter-54-the-revelation-of-jesus-christ---unto-his-servant-john.p59"},"While we know that there were other branches of the church in Asia, it may be that by the time of John’s revelation on Patmos, the apostasy had eliminated all but these seven as faithful branches.

Even the seven branches (",["span.small","A.D."],"95), it would seem, had things of which they needed to repent.

We know from latter-day revelation that an important part of the Lord’s purpose in directing John to write what he saw was to give the saints of the last dispensation an understanding of the events of the last days, the period of time in which much that John saw would be fulfilled. The prophet Nephi, also privileged to behold the things that John saw, was told that the honor of recording the vision was reserved for John (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.19-25"},"1 Nephi 14:19–25"],").

The occidental peoples tend to use language like a contractor uses building materials: he builds structures which are concrete in detail and form. But the oriental world, of which the Holy Land was a part, is more artistic in its use of language. Words are but colors with which the artist paints verbal pictures.

And related to that is the hidden manna. Let me read you something from the great “Bread of Life” sermon in John’s gospel.

Right here in these seven ancient letters we have one of the great gospel summaries. Nowhere else except in the 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants can you find such a complete description of the promises awaiting those who go to the celestial kingdom. In these brief chapters, the Lord lays out a summary that is as beautifully applicable to you and me today as it was to the saints in Asia. He gives the rule: Hold fast to the good things you are doing; repent of the bad. Then he lists, briefly but comprehensively, examples of both the good and the bad. Then he describes the conditions awaiting those who are obedient to that rule. Now you can see why Jesus said, “He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/rev/3.6"},"Revelation 3:6"],".)"]]]]]]]]],"refs":null}
