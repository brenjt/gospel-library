joined the Church at age sixteen. Because I was young, I thought that genealogy work was not for me. Anyway, I was a new convert, and there were so many other things to learn and do. It was two years after my conversion that I finally saw the light. I was in our young adult Sunday School class when our instructor, Brother Parsons, asked: “How many of you love your family?” It was such an obvious answer that every hand went up. He continued by asking, “Now, how many of you have a book of remembrance with at least four generations of genealogical work completed?—that is, family group sheets and pedigree charts? Only about three of the thirty young adults raised their hands. Needless to say, I was one of those who didn’t respond in the affirmative. “But what do group sheets have to do with loving your family?” I asked. I guess Brother Parsons was waiting for that question, because I shall never forget his answer. He said, “Bob, your ancestors who died without a knowledge of the gospel are probably being taught the truth right now in the spirit world. Many of them are probably just as anxious to be baptized and receive the blessings of the Church as you were two years ago. But without you they will have to wait. How would you have felt two years ago if your parents had not given their permission for you to be baptized? What would you have said if they had told you not to bother them about joining the Church, that maybe someday they’d get around to giving you permission? You are in that same position as far as your ancestors are concerned. They are waiting for you. When I asked the class how many of them love their families and then asked about the pedigree charts, I was serious. Genealogical research and temple work are works of love. Those who really love their families will do all they can to save them.
