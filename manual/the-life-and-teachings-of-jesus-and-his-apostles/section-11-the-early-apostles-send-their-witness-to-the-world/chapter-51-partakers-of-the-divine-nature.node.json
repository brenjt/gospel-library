New problems seem to have arisen in the church. Where before the threat to the church was persecution from without, the danger now seems to be apostasy from within. “There shall be false teachers among you,” wrote the chief apostle, “who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord. …” (2:1). The great danger to the church was that many in the future would follow after these teachers out of ignorance and uncertainty. The letter twice reminds the saints of the things they had been taught (1:12–15; 3:1, 2): first, that if they go on to make their calling and election sure, they will not fall (1:10, 11); and second, that the second coming of the Lord was certain and sure, even though scoffers, as prophesied, would deny the fact because of what seemed to them an unreasonable delay. Peter wrote the letter, therefore, to warn of an impending apostasy within the church and to exhort the saints to continue to grow in knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. This counsel if followed would lead them to make their callings and elections sure."]],[".topic",["h4","(51-5)",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.1-19"},"2 Peter 1:1–19"],".

There are many today who, like the A.W.O.L. soldier, in their flight to find freedom find themselves in a bondage far worse than that which they sought to escape. Well might they ponder the observation of Elder James E.

It is the nature of God.

We are promised that, since Christ has obtained this fulness, we, through obedience to him, may ultimately do so also.

Of course, we are only called to achieve this great destiny. The calling—the election, the promise, the opportunity—has been extended to us by the Lord, but no one is going to force us to fulfil it and make certain; it is very much a matter of free agency. But already we have done something to suggest our seriousness in accepting the calling and election which has been offered to us. For instance, you have elected to join the Saints and meet with them, to pray, to read the scriptures, to study this lesson. Your calling to be a partaker of the divine nature—to become like God—has not come about in a vacuum; the election is not only God’s, but yours as well. Indeed, in earlier lessons (for example, lesson 3) it has been suggested that we sought this opportunity even before we entered mortality.
