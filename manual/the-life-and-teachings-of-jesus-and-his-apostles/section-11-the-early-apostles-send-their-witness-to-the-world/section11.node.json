Contemporary public opinion said that Nero, seeking to cover his crimes and to appropriate a sizable area in the center of the city for a new palace, was himself the incendiary. To dispel this rumor, Nero cast the blame for the fire on the Christians. The teaching of the church that the eventual destruction of the world was to be by fire led credibility to the accusation. A general persecution against the saints followed. Tacitus, a Roman historian, chronicled the extent and severity of what became known as the first Roman persecution of the church."],["p.para",{"id":"p13","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-11-the-early-apostles-send-their-witness-to-the-world/section11.p13"},"“But all human efforts, all the largesses of the emperor, all the propitiations of the gods, failed to dispel the sinister belief that the conflagration had been ordered. Consequently, to scotch the rumor, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures upon a group hated for their abominations, whom the populace called Christians. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, had been condemned to death in the reign of Tiberius by the procurator Pontius Pilate, and the pernicious superstition, thus suppressed for the moment, was breaking out again not only in Judea, the original source of this evil, but even in Rome, where all things horrible or shameful from all parts of the world collect[ed] and became popular. First, then, those who confessed membership were arrested; then, on their information, great numbers were convicted, not so much of guilt for the conflagration as of hatred of the human race. And mockery was added to their deaths: they were covered with the skins of wild beasts and torn to death by dogs, or they were nailed to crosses and, when daylight failed, were set on fire and burned to provide light at night. Nero had offered his gardens for the spectacle, and was providing circus games, mingling with the populace in the dress of a charioteer or driving a chariot. Hence, though they were deserving of the most extreme punishment, a feeling of pity arose because of the savagery of one man.” (Naphtali Lewis and Meyer Reinhold,",["span.emphasis","Roman Civilization,"],"3:226–27.)"],["p.para",{"id":"p14","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-11-the-early-apostles-send-their-witness-to-the-world/section11.p14"},"The burning of Rome could be likened to a “fiery trial” about to be inflicted upon the membership of the church.

By this time Christianity had been declared an illegal society in the empire; and unless the saints renounced Christ, they were executed. Trajan, determined to see the law upheld, directed that Christians not be sought out, but if they were discovered and did not renounce the faith, they were to be executed.

Thus, Peter directed the apostles in their efforts to choose a successor to Judas Iscariot (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/1.15-26"},"Acts 1:15–26"],"). On the day of Pentecost, it was Peter who became the spokesman for the apostles and saints (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/2.14"},"Acts 2:14"],"). Peter received the revelation which authorized missionary efforts among the gentiles (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/10.1"},"Acts 10:1–11:18"],"), and he it was who declared the policy regarding circumcision (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/15.1-29"},"Acts 15:1–29"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/gal/2.1-10"},"Galatians 2:1–10"],"). As with many of the ancient saints, Peter suffered much from persecution, first in Jerusalem (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/5.29-32,40"},"Acts 5:29–32, 40"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/12"},"chapter 12"],") and later in Rome. From ancient tradition it is learned that the apostle was arrested while he was in Rome and crucified near the end of the reign of Nero. It is said that at his own request Peter was crucified upside down because he considered himself unworthy to be crucified in the same manner as was the Savior (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/21.18,19"},"John 21:18, 19"],").

Though at one point in his life he denied knowing the Lord, yet he later received the transforming power of the Holy Ghost. His faith in the Lord Jesus Christ became so powerful that when he was threatened, beaten, and maligned by his Sanhedrin persecutors, he boldly testified, “We ought to obey God rather than men.” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/5.29"},"Acts 5:29"],".) Peter was “a man who had grown perfect through his experiences and sufferings—a man with vision, a man of revelations, a man fully trusted by his Lord Jesus Christ.” (Spencer W.
