John is not suggesting that common courtesy cannot be extended to those who teach contrary doctrines. But in his time, the phrase he used also meant to welcome one into the home, to accept him as a guest. It was this kind of hospitality that enabled the itinerant preachers to exist and carry on their work. Thus, extending greeting was akin to supporting the work of these teachers.

For example, if you find that you are not inviting the Brethren into your life, study some of the messages of the General Authorities in the latest conference issue of the Ensign. If you find that frictions arise easily between you and other people (roommates, family, church associates), make a sincere effort to subdue your pride and seek to understand and look for the good in others. As you actively strive to apply a principle of the gospel to your life, you will find yourself “contending for the faith.”"]]]]]]]]],"refs":null}
