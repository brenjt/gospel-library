This loyal man could not rest; visited by the martyred Abel, taught by the translated Enoch, custodian of truths he was forbidden to teach, whose preaching almost resembled the roaring of a lion, he was a man with a witness and with a call.

Perhaps it might be well to point out here that Corinth had a worldwide reputation in the ancient world for its immorality. It was located very close to two major ports and therefore subject to many of the vices and evils which accompany centers of commerce and trade. In addition, Corinth was the site of the famous temple of Aphrodite (Venus), the goddess of love, where there were a thousand “priestesses.” They were actually nothing more than prostitutes glorified by the cloak of religious worship. Anciently, Corinth’s reputation was such that to “Corinthianize” meant to engage in reckless debauchery, and Corinthians were usually portrayed on the stage as drunkards. Even in modern English a person is sometimes called a Corinthian, meaning that he is given totally over to licentious desires.
