This was the Paul who, though it was midnight and his feet were clamped in prison stocks and his back was torn and bloody from the repeated blows of the lash, sang hymns of praise to God. The apostle who bore witness to the Thessalonians of Christ’s power to deliver from sin was the apostle who had, in Philippi, witnessed doors fly open and chains break free with the quaking of the earth.

Questions of social solidarity, sexual purity, and honest labor were three problems faced by the converts in Thessalonica. Had most of the Thessalonian saints been Jewish converts, it would seem that they would not have had the same problems to such a degree. Why?
