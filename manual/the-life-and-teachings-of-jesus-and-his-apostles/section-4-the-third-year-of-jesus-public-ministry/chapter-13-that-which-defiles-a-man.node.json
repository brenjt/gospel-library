At this point in the life of Jesus, this hatred had grown to such a point that the Jews were plotting to take his life. Frustrated in an attempt to get Jesus to Jerusalem so that they might fulfill their plans, the Jews sent a delegation from Jerusalem to try to trap the Lord into saying or doing something that would give them license to seek his life. When these Jews saw some of the disciples of Jesus eating without first washing their hands, they accused Jesus of not following the law of Moses. In his reply to their accusation, Jesus said, “Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/15.11"},"Matthew 15:11"],".)"],["p.para",{"id":"p49","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-4-the-third-year-of-jesus-public-ministry/chapter-13-that-which-defiles-a-man.p49"},"This was a stinging rebuke which offended and incensed these scribes and Pharisees.

After shattering the basis of their external religion, he discredited the authority of the Pharisees and scribes with the people by calling the multitude to him and by speaking these powerful words: “Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/15.11"},"Matthew 15:11"],".)"],["p.para",{"id":"p57","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-4-the-third-year-of-jesus-public-ministry/chapter-13-that-which-defiles-a-man.p57"},"For his denunciation of their tradition, the Pharisees were offended.

His ability to cross-examine and to question is renowned. Dignified and important, he is an aristocrat among the common people who have no knowledge of the law. Regarding faith and religious practice, he is the authority and the last word; and as a teacher of the law, as a judge in ecclesiastical courts, is the learned one who must be respected, whose judgment is infallible. He travels in the company of the Pharisees, yet he is not necessarily a member of this religious party. He holds office and has status. His worth is beyond that of all the common folk and they must honor him, for he is to be praised by God and by angels in heaven.

Under certain conditions, successive washings were prescribed, in connection with which we find mention of ‘first,’ ‘second’ and ‘other’ waters, the ‘second water’ being necessary to wash away the ‘first water,’ which had become defiled by contact with the ‘common’ hands; and so further with the later waters. Sometimes the hands had to be dipped or immersed; at other times they were to be cleansed by pouring, it being necessary that the water be allowed to run to the wrist or the elbow according to the degree of supposed defilement; then again, as the disciples of Rabbi Shammai held, only the finger tips, or the fingers up to the knuckles, needed to be wetted under particular circumstances. Rules for the cleansing of vessels and furniture were detailed and exacting; distinct methods applied respectively to vessels of clay, wood, and metal. Fear of unwittingly defiling the hands led to many extreme precautions. It being known that the Roll of the Law, the Roll of the Prophets, and other scriptures, when laid away were sometimes touched, scratched, or even gnawed by mice, there was issued a rabbinical decree, that the Holy Scriptures, or any part thereof comprising as many as eighty-five letters (the shortest section in the law having just that number), defiled the hands by mere contact.

Brother Packer yesterday pleaded with eloquence that we sing the songs of Zion in order to center our thoughts on wholesome things. I would like to add that we can also—after we have had the opening song—call on ourselves to preach a sermon. I have preached many sermons walking along congested city streets, or tramping desert trails, or in lonely places, thus centering my mind on the Lord’s affairs and the things of righteousness; and I might say they have been better sermons than I have ever preached to congregations."],["p.para",{"id":"p90","uri":"/manual/the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-and-his-apostles/section-4-the-third-year-of-jesus-public-ministry/chapter-13-that-which-defiles-a-man.p90"},"“If we are going to work out our salvation, we must rejoice in the Lord.

Our thoughts mirror our character and the degree of inward purity we have obtained during our brief stay on earth. Our thoughts constitute an index of our inward purity. If our thoughts are noble and rich, if they focus on that which is virtuous, lovely, of good report, or praiseworthy, we may be assured that our character is built of virtue, beauty, love, that which is good, and that which the Lord and righteous men esteem to be of great worth. If men’s thoughts are ignoble and impoverished, if they focus on that which is immoral, ugly, worthy of condemnation, or not admirable, we may be assured that their character is likewise affected.
