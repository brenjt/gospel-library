Christ’s return from the marriage feast is his Second Advent, or it may mean his judgment of each individual soul at death. The ‘marriage feast’ here is not the final joy of the blessed, as in the parable of the Ten Virgins, but Christ’s session at the right hand of God between the Ascension and the Second Advent.

Some give up all worldly possessions and spend their lives living and working among the poor. Others sacrifice marriage, family, and friends for a life of study, contemplation, and prayer. Still others strive to live “normal” lives while devoting time whenever possible to acts of service. Given the teachings of prophets, scriptures, and modern revelation, how do you view the responsibilities of discipleship? Is it possible to remain in the mainstream of life, or should we retreat? Can one rightfully seek after wealth and yet be of value to the Lord? Must one be willing to give all to be counted among the faithful who are prepared for the Second Coming?

It is no good posing as a lifeguard if one is a non-swimmer. It is no good being a guide if one leaves his post and wanders with the multitude in search of another way, ‘for there is none other way,’ especially at a time when there is a sharper and sharper divergence in the way of the world and the straight and narrow way.

They followed him until he began to preach the ‘hard sayings’—the doctrines that really demand not only belief, but performance; doctrines which would distinguish them from their contemporary society. The Lord wants us to put some distance—behaviorally—between ourselves and the world, not because we love mankind less, but precisely because we do love men. It is for the world’s sake that we must sanctify ourselves.
