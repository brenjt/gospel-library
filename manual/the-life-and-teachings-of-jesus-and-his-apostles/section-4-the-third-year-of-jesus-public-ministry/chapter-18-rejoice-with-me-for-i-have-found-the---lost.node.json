One cannot enjoy membership in the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan at the same time. To attempt to do so is to partake of that leaven—hypocrisy—that Jesus so strongly condemned. Ordinarily it is difficult to amass huge treasures both on earth and in heaven at the same time because obtaining earthly riches often diverts one from his spiritual interests. However, some have done it successfully because the Lord blessed them for their faithfulness first to his commandments. Abraham seems to be an example of this.
