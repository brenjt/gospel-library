Nine years into the project, in the summer of 1862, the foundation was complete. Then Church leaders performed an evaluation and concluded that the temple’s foundation stones would not be adequate to sustain the weight of the temple over time. President Brigham Young determined to replace the massive foundation. This would be no easy task, for the foundation was sixteen feet (five meters) deep and sixteen feet wide, and the temple dimensions were 186 by 99 feet (57 by 30 meters). In explaining his decision, President Young said that he expected this temple to stand through the Millennium. The Saints then set about to complete the task.
