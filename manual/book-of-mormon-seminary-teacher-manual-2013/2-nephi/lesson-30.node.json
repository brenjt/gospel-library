He warned against attitudes and actions that lead to separation from the Lord, and he testified of attitudes and actions that allow people to come to Christ and be saved. On the next day, Jacob reiterated that although the house of Israel would be scattered because of sin, the Lord would remember His covenants with them and gather them when they would repent and return to Him. Jacob prophesied of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ. He also prophesied that his people’s promised land would be a place of liberty, fortified against all nations and free from the reign of kings. Jacob exhorted his people to reconcile themselves to God’s will and remember that they could be saved only through God’s grace."]],[".sidebar box-decor box-right",{"id":"f105","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/2-nephi/lesson-30.f105"},["h3","Teach by the Spirit"],["p.para",{"id":"p6","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/2-nephi/lesson-30.p6"},"As a gospel teacher, you are to seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost in your preparation and teaching. “The Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.14"},"D&C 42:14"],")."]],[".topic",{"id":"t76","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/2-nephi/lesson-30.t76"},["h2","Suggestions for Teaching"],[".topic",{"id":"t77","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/2-nephi/lesson-30.t77"},["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.27-54"},"2 Nephi 9:27–54"]],["h4","Jacob invites all to come unto Christ and warns of attitudes and actions that separate us from the Lord"],["p.para",{"id":"p10","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/2-nephi/lesson-30.p10"},"On the board, write the phrases",["span.emphasis","why I need help"],"and",["span.emphasis","what I must do."],"Have the class imagine a person who has a terrible disease."],["ul.bullet",["li",["span.label","•"],["p","Why is it important that this person understand the need to seek help?"]],["li",["span.label","•"],["p","Why is it important that the person also understand what to do to receive help?"]],["li",["span.label","•"],["p","What will result if the person understands the need for help but does not understand what to do to receive it?"]]],["p.para",{"id":"p14","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/2-nephi/lesson-30.p14"},"Remind students that in the previous lesson, they studied the effects of the Fall and the consequences of our sins, learning about why we need the Savior.
