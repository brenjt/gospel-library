Mormon wrote it more than 500 years after Amaleki concluded the book of Omni. In this book, Mormon briefly explains his compilation and abridgment of the records of his people. To understand his explanation, it is helpful to remember that the Lord commanded Nephi to make two sets of plates for a “special” and “wise” purpose (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/9.3,5"},"1 Nephi 9:3, 5"],"). One set of plates, often called the large plates, contained the secular history of the Nephites, while the other set, often called the small plates, contained a sacred record of the Nephites’ preaching, revelations, and prophecies (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/9.2-4"},"1 Nephi 9:2–4"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1.3-4"},"Jacob 1:3–4"],")."],["p.para",{"id":"p12","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/words-of-mormon/words-of-mormon.p12"},"Mormon discovered the small plates of Nephi after he had already made an abridgment of part of the large plates (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1.3"},"Words of Mormon 1:3"],"). Guided by the Spirit of the Lord, Mormon included the small plates with his abridgment of the large plates. He did this “for a wise purpose,” according to the Lord’s will (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1.4-7"},"Words of Mormon 1:4–7"],")."],["p.para",{"id":"p13","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/words-of-mormon/words-of-mormon.p13"},"Many years later, one reason for this inspiration became apparent. When Joseph Smith began translating the Book of Mormon, he started with Mormon’s abridgment of the large plates of Nephi—the secular history. Martin Harris, who was the Prophet’s scribe for this portion of the translation, lost 116 pages of the manuscript. The Lord revealed to Joseph Smith that wicked men had obtained those pages and changed the words (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.8-10"},"D&C 10:8–10"],"). If Joseph had translated the same material again, those men would have claimed that he was not a prophet because he could not translate the book the same way twice (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.11-19"},"D&C 10:11–19"],"). The Lord told Joseph not to translate that part again but to translate the small plates of Nephi that Mormon had included with his abridgment of the large plates (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.30-45"},"D&C 10:30–45"],"). Thus, Words of Mormon helps us see how the Lord prepared a way to frustrate the plan of wicked men and to include scripture that not only covered the same time period as the lost manuscript but provided “greater views upon [the Lord’s] gospel” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.45"},"D&C 10:45"],"). Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught: “Obviously it would be exciting if someone were one day to find the lost 116 pages of the original manuscript of the Book of Mormon. But whatever those pages contain, it could not be more important or more fundamental to the purpose of the Book of Mormon than the teachings … recorded on the small plates” (",["span.emphasis","Christ and the New Covenant: The Messianic Message of the Book of Mormon"],"[1997], 35–36)."],["p.para",{"id":"p14","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/words-of-mormon/words-of-mormon.p14"},"In addition to sharing insights about the compilation of his people’s sacred records, Mormon provided a brief description of the service of King Benjamin (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1.10-18"},"Words of Mormon 1:10–18"],"). This description helps to connect the small plates of Nephi with Mormon’s abridgment of the large plates. King Benjamin is mentioned at the conclusion of the book of Omni, which is the final book in the small plates (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/omni/1.23-25"},"Omni 1:23–25"],"). The book of Mosiah, the first book in what we have of Mormon’s abridgment of the large plates, begins by relating the close of King Benjamin’s reign and ministry (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1.1,9"},"Mosiah 1:1, 9"],")."]],[".topic",{"id":"t6","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/words-of-mormon/words-of-mormon.t6"},["h2","Outline"],["p.para",{"id":"p16","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/words-of-mormon/words-of-mormon.p16"},["b",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1.1-9"},"Words of Mormon 1:1–9"]],"Mormon discovers the small plates of Nephi and includes them with his abridgment of the large plates."],["p.para",{"id":"p17","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/words-of-mormon/words-of-mormon.p17"},["b",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1.10-18"},"Words of Mormon 1:10–18"]],"Mormon summarizes the reign of King Benjamin."]]]]]],"refs":null}
