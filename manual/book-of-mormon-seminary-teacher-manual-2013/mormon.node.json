When Mormon was about 10 years old, the record keeper Ammaron charged him to take responsibility for the sacred records when he came of age. He was to record everything he observed concerning the people (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/1.4"},"Mormon 1:4"],"). At age 15, Mormon was “visited of the Lord, and tasted and knew of the goodness of Jesus” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/1.15"},"Mormon 1:15"],"). In the same year, the Nephites appointed Mormon to lead their armies (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/2.1"},"Mormon 2:1"],"). Obedient to Ammaron’s counsel, he later obtained the large plates of Nephi and began to make his record. He also abridged the large plates of Nephi, which included writings from prophets and record keepers from Lehi through Ammaron, and inserted the small plates of Nephi into that abridgement. Near the end of his life, Mormon deposited all the records in the Hill Cumorah, except for a few plates that he gave to his son Moroni (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/6.6"},"Mormon 6:6"],"). He then led the Nephites in their last great battle against the Lamanites. Before Mormon died, he directed Moroni to complete his record. Moroni added the words that make up chapters 8–9 of this book."]],[".topic",{"id":"t3","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/mormon/mormon.t3"},["h2","To whom was this book written and why?"],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/mormon/mormon.p7"},"Mormon wrote to Gentiles and members of the house of Israel in the latter days, desiring to “persuade all [the] ends of the earth to repent and prepare to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/morm/3.22"},"Mormon 3:22"],").
