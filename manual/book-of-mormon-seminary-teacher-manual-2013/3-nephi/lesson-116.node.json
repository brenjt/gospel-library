Unbelievers threatened to kill the believers if the prophecy was not fulfilled by a certain day. Nephi, a son of Nephi and grandson of Helaman, pleaded with the Lord on behalf of the believers. In answer to Nephi’s prayer, the voice of the Lord came to him, declaring that the sign would be given that night. When the sun set, there was no darkness, and a new star appeared. Despite Satan’s continued attempts to destroy the faith of the people, the majority of the people were converted to the Lord. But two years later, the Gadianton robbers began to lead many Nephites and Lamanites into wickedness."]],[".topic",{"id":"t8","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/3-nephi/lesson-116.t8"},["h2","Suggestions for Teaching"],[".topic",{"id":"t9","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/3-nephi/lesson-116.t9"},["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.1-26"},"3 Nephi 1:1–26"]],["h4","Prophecies concerning Jesus Christ’s birth are fulfilled, and many Nephites are converted"],["p.para",{"id":"p8","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/3-nephi/lesson-116.p8"},"Invite students to think of people who have sacrificed their lives for the gospel.
