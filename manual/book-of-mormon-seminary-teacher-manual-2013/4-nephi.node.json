It does so by illustrating the blessings that result when people repent, come unto Jesus Christ, and make covenants with Him. It also shows the destructive consequences that occur when people deny the Savior and His gospel and forsake their covenants."]],[".topic",{"id":"t4","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/4-nephi/4-nephi.t4"},["h2","When and where was it written?"],["p.para",{"id":"p9","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/4-nephi/4-nephi.p9"},"The original records used as sources for the book of 4 Nephi were likely written between",["span.small","A.D."],"34 and",["span.small","A.D."],"321.

The brevity of 4 Nephi contributes to its power. It succinctly highlights the contrast between the people’s righteousness immediately following the Savior’s ministry among them and their wickedness four generations later. The book’s first 18 verses illustrate the blessings enjoyed by a society that is built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ. Later verses provide a witness of the destructiveness of pride, showing how this society gradually weakened until it was almost entirely consumed in sin."]],[".topic",{"id":"t6","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/4-nephi/4-nephi.t6"},["h2","Outline"],["p.para",{"id":"p13","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2013/4-nephi/4-nephi.p13"},["b",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.1-18"},"4 Nephi 1:1–18"]],"Following the ministry of Jesus Christ, all the people throughout the land are converted and baptized.
