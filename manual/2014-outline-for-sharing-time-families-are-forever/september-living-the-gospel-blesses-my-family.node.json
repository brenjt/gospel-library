Grant’s father died when he was just nine days old. His mother was very poor and earned money by sewing for other people. Sometimes she sewed for so many hours without resting that she could hardly push the pedal of her sewing machine. Heber would often crawl under the sewing machine and push the pedal for her. The winters were very cold, and Heber had only a thin, worn coat to keep him warm. He longed to have a warm coat but knew that they barely had enough money for food. He was delighted on his birthday when his mother gave him a warm coat that she had sewn. It was his most prized possession. A few weeks later, Heber saw a boy shivering with cold and he remembered how it felt. He took off his new coat and gave it to the boy.” You may also want to consider showing the video “The Coat,” available at www.mormonchannel.org/the-coat.) Discuss how Heber served others, and invite a few children and teachers to share experiences they have had with service. Discuss that when we serve others we are serving God.
