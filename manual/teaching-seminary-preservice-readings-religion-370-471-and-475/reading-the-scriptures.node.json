This is the most profitable of all study in which we could engage. The portion of scripture known as the Old and New Testaments is often referred to as the great literature of the world. These books have been regarded as scientific treatises, as philosophic dissertations, and also as historical records; but if we understand the true purpose of these and other scriptures, we realize that they are really the fundamental literature of religion."],[".img-left",{"id":"f1","uri":"/manual/teaching-seminary-preservice-readings-religion-370-471-and-475/reading-the-scriptures.f1"},[".caption",["b","ELDER HOWARD W.

Throughout each of the books there is an appeal to believe and have faith in God the Eternal Father and in his son, Jesus Christ; and from the first to the last of these books of scripture is the call to do the will of God and keep his commandments."],["div",{"id":"p8","uri":"/manual/teaching-seminary-preservice-readings-religion-370-471-and-475/reading-the-scriptures.p8"},"Scriptures contain the record of the self-revelation of God, and through them God speaks to man. Where could there be more profitable use of time than reading from the scriptural library the literature that teaches us to know God and understand our relationship to him? Time is always precious to busy people, and we are robbed of its worth when hours are wasted in reading or viewing that which is frivolous and of little value."],["div",{"id":"p9","uri":"/manual/teaching-seminary-preservice-readings-religion-370-471-and-475/reading-the-scriptures.p9"},"Reading habits vary widely. There are rapid readers and slow readers, some who read only small snatches at a time and others who persist without stopping until the book is finished. Those who delve into the scriptural library, however, find that to understand requires more than casual reading or perusal—there must be concentrated study. It is certain that one who studies the scriptures every day accomplishes far more than one who devotes considerable time one day and then lets days go by before continuing. Not only should we study each day, but there should be a regular time set aside when we can concentrate without interference."]],[".topic",["h2","Prayer"],["div",{"id":"p11","uri":"/manual/teaching-seminary-preservice-readings-religion-370-471-and-475/reading-the-scriptures.p11"},"There is nothing more helpful than prayer to open our understanding of the scriptures. Through prayer we can attune our minds to seek the answers to our searchings.

It would be ideal if an hour could be spent each day; but if that much cannot be had, a half hour on a regular basis would result in substantial accomplishment. A quarter of an hour is little time, but it is surprising how much enlightenment and knowledge can be acquired in a subject so meaningful. The important thing is to allow nothing else to ever interfere with our study."],["div",{"id":"p15","uri":"/manual/teaching-seminary-preservice-readings-religion-370-471-and-475/reading-the-scriptures.p15"},"Some prefer to study alone, but companions can study together profitably. Families are greatly blessed when wise fathers and mothers bring their children about them, read from the pages of the scriptural library together, and then discuss freely the beautiful stories and thoughts according to the understanding of all. Often youth and little ones have amazing insight into and appreciation for the basic literature of religion."],["div",{"id":"p16","uri":"/manual/teaching-seminary-preservice-readings-religion-370-471-and-475/reading-the-scriptures.p16"},"We should not be haphazard in our reading but rather develop a systematic plan for study. There are some who read to a schedule of a number of pages or a set number of chapters each day or week. This may be perfectly justifiable and may be enjoyable if one is reading for pleasure, but it does not constitute meaningful study. It is better to have a set amount of time to give scriptural study each day than to have a set amount of chapters to read. Sometimes we find that the study of a single verse will occupy the whole time."]],[".topic",["h2","Contemplation"],["div",{"id":"p18","uri":"/manual/teaching-seminary-preservice-readings-religion-370-471-and-475/reading-the-scriptures.p18"},"The life, acts, and teachings of Jesus can be read rapidly. The stories are simple in most instances and the stories are simply told.

Its use in this instance designates suddenness or unexpectedness. Jesus and those who were with him had just recrossed the Sea of Galilee, and a multitude of people who had been waiting met him on the shore near Capernaum. “And, behold [suddenly and unexpectedly], there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue.” The larger synagogues of that day were presided over by a college of elders under the direction of a chief or a ruler.

Many, many lives have become memorable that otherwise would have been lost in obscurity had it not been for the touch of the Master’s hand that made a significant change of thought and action and a new and better life."],["div",{"id":"p27","uri":"/manual/teaching-seminary-preservice-readings-religion-370-471-and-475/reading-the-scriptures.p27"},"“And when he saw him [that is, when Jairus saw Jesus], he fell at his feet.”"],["div",{"id":"p28","uri":"/manual/teaching-seminary-preservice-readings-religion-370-471-and-475/reading-the-scriptures.p28"},"This was an unusual circumstance for a man of rank and prestige, a ruler of the synagogue, to kneel at Jesus’ feet—at the feet of one considered to be an itinerant teacher with the gift of healing.
