That being the case, they need to understand the nature of law; the source of law; the means by which they can know true laws; the results of the application of laws, or what one may obtain by following the laws of God; and how the Lord has counseled His children to act in relationship to laws so that they can obtain the greatest benefits."],["div",{"id":"p409","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/enrichments/enrichment-g-the-nature-and-purpose-of-law.p409"},"The Doctrine and Covenants helps the Saints to understand the nature, purpose, and effects of law."],[".",{"id":"f15","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/enrichments/enrichment-g-the-nature-and-purpose-of-law.f15"},[".caption","“All things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.35"},"Moses 1:35"],")."]]],[".topic",["h2","(G-2) The Eternal Nature of Law"],["div",{"id":"p411","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/enrichments/enrichment-g-the-nature-and-purpose-of-law.p411"},"The Doctrine and Covenants teaches that “all kingdoms have a law given; and … there is no space in the which there is no kingdom” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.36-37"},"D&C 88:36–37"],").

He taught that through obedience to His laws His children are freed from sin, weakness, darkness, and despair; they obtain power over all their enemies and gain power to lay hold of every righteous desire of their hearts. They become free of every encumbrance that holds them back or binds them down.
