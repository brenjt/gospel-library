The Lord has given instruction repeatedly that all who go to Zion shall obey His law—the celestial law on which Zion was to be built. Those who were weak in the faith, or indifferent to the commandments, were warned that they would not be made welcome in that land unless they repented. ‘Hearken, O ye people, and open your hearts and give ear from afar; and listen, you that call yourselves the people of the Lord, and hear the word of the Lord and his will concerning you.’ These are the words by which this revelation is introduced.” (Smith,",["span.emphasis","Church History and Modern Revelation,"],"1:229.)"],["div",{"id":"p25","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-60-68/section-63-for-this-is-a-day-of-warning-and-not-a-day-of-many-words.p25"},"The Prophet Joseph Smith explained: “In these infant days of the Church, there was a great anxiety to obtain the word of the Lord upon every subject that in any way concerned our salvation; and as the land of Zion was now the most important temporal object in view, I enquired of the Lord for further information upon the gathering of the Saints, and the purchase of the land, and other matters, and received the following: [",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63"},"D&C 63"],"].” (",["span.emphasis","History of the Church,"],"1:207.)"]],[".topic",["h2","Notes and Commentary"],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.1-6"},"D&C 63:1–6"],". “Listen, You That Call Yourselves the People of the Lord”"],["div",{"id":"p26","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-60-68/section-63-for-this-is-a-day-of-warning-and-not-a-day-of-many-words.p26"},"The Lord in His revelations teaches the Saints that in order for them to inhabit Zion, they must be a righteous people (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58"},"D&C 58–59, 97, 101, 103, 105"],"). The Lord opened this revelation with a solemn reminder that His commandments are not to be taken lightly and that those who ignore them or rebel against them will be punished. The reminder was necessary, since many of the early Saints claimed to be anxious to build Zion but were not being obedient to the laws God had revealed. The Prophet Joseph Smith also tried to teach the Saints the same principle: “We know not what we shall be called to pass through before Zion is delivered and established; therefore, we have great need to live near to God, and always be in strict obedience to all His commandments, that we may have a conscience void of offense toward God and man” (",["span.emphasis","Teachings,"],"p. 32)."],[".",{"id":"f2","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-60-68/section-63-for-this-is-a-day-of-warning-and-not-a-day-of-many-words.f2"},[".caption","Joseph Smith taught that faith is a key to the power of God."]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.7-12"},"D&C 63:7–12"],".

The Lord gives certain principles, and by obedience to them, blessings and power follow. But one has no proof of that promise until one acts on the basis of trust or belief. Then comes the confirmation of the reality of the principle, but only after one acts in faith and trust. That is why James taught that “faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/james/2.17"},"James 2:17"],"). Moroni taught the same principle when he explained that the evidence that the principles are true and will bring power cannot be known for sure at first, but can only be hoped for until one acts on the principle: “Faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, … ye receive no witness [confirmation] until after the trial of your faith” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.6"},"Ether 12:6"],")."],["div",{"id":"p30","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-60-68/section-63-for-this-is-a-day-of-warning-and-not-a-day-of-many-words.p30"},"The Lord will give confirming evidence of all gospel principles if we are willing to act on the basis of faith. Imagine a person who says, “Before I pay my tithing, I must know for sure that it is a true principle.” The Lord’s way is just the opposite. He says, “First act in faith and pay your tithing, then I will give you evidence it is a true principle.” The Savior taught this relationship during His mortal ministry: “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/7.17"},"John 7:17"],")."],["div",{"id":"p31","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-60-68/section-63-for-this-is-a-day-of-warning-and-not-a-day-of-many-words.p31"},"When we understand this process, we can see why sign seeking is condemned. Someone who demands outward evidence of the power of God as a condition for believing is seeking to circumvent the process by which faith is developed. He wants proof without price. As with the adulterer, he seeks the results without accepting the responsibility. Thus it is a wicked and adulterous generation that seeks signs."],["div",{"id":"p32","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-60-68/section-63-for-this-is-a-day-of-warning-and-not-a-day-of-many-words.p32"},"The Prophet Joseph Smith said: “I will give you one of the Keys of the mysteries of the Kingdom.

The principle is as correct as the one that Jesus put forth in saying that he who seeketh a sign is an adulterous person; and that principle is eternal, undeviating, and firm as the pillars of heaven; for whenever you see a man seeking after a sign, you may set it down that he is an adulterous man.” (",["span.emphasis","Teachings,"],"pp. 156–57.)"]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.16"},"D&C 63:16"],". “He That Looketh upon a Woman to Lust After Her”"],["div",{"id":"p33","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-60-68/section-63-for-this-is-a-day-of-warning-and-not-a-day-of-many-words.p33"},"Thought always precedes action, as President David O.
