Soon after his baptism he traveled to Fayette, New York, to meet the Prophet. The Prophet Joseph Smith recorded: “In December Sidney Rigdon came to inquire of the Lord, and with him came Edward Partridge; the latter was a pattern of piety, and one of the Lord’s great men.

During those years the hand of the Lord was over him and directing him in the gathering of many earnest souls who could not accept the teachings of the sects of the day. His prayers in which he sought further light than the world was able to give, were now to be answered. The Lord informed him that he had been sent to prepare the way, and in the gathering of his colony and the building up of his congregation in and around Kirtland, the hand of the Lord was directing him, and the way for the reception of the fulness of truth was being prepared. It should be carefully noted that a great number of forceful, intelligent men who became leaders in the Church had been gathered by Sidney Rigdon, with the help of the Lord, in this part of the land. Without any question, the Spirit of the Lord had rested upon these men, as it did on Sidney Rigdon and Parley P. Pratt, to direct them to gather in Kirtland at that early day. When, therefore, Parley P. Pratt, Ziba Peterson and their companions came to Kirtland they found the way prepared for them through the preaching, very largely, of Sidney Rigdon, so that it was not a difficult matter for these missionaries to convince this group of the truth. While Sidney was preaching and baptizing by immersion without authority, which the Lord informed him in this revelation, yet it all resulted in good when the Gospel message reached them. These men were not only convinced and ready for baptism, but were in a condition by which the Priesthood could be given them, and this was done.” (",["span.emphasis","Church History and Modern Revelation,"],"1:160.)"],[".",{"id":"f7","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-30-40/section-35-i-have---prepared-thee-for-a-greater-work.f7"},[".caption","Sidney Rigdon was a spokesman for Joseph Smith."]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/35.8-10"},"D&C 35:8–10"],". “Mine Arm Is Not Shortened”"],["div",{"id":"p71","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-30-40/section-35-i-have---prepared-thee-for-a-greater-work.p71"},"The phrase “arm of the Lord” suggests God’s power, might, and authority (see",["a.crossRef",{"href":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/sections-1-9/section-1-the-lords-preface-the-voice-of-warning.p1"},"Notes and Commentary on D&C 1:14"],").
