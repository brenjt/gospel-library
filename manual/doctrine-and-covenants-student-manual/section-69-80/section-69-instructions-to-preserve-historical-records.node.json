The Prophet writes that at this time there were many things which the elders desired to know relative to preaching the Gospel to the inhabitants of the earth, and concerning the gathering and in compliance with their wish on the 3rd of November, the day after the conference closed, he inquired of the Lord and received the revelation which was also ordered printed with the commandments, but having been considered after the conference, it was to be placed in the volume as part of an appendix. This revelation is known as Section 133. …"],["div",{"id":"p2","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-69-80/section-69-instructions-to-preserve-historical-records.p2"},"“It is an erroneous thought to believe that the Prophet selected all of the revelations he had received and placed them in the collection which was to become The Book of Commandments. Each of the revelations selected for that volume was placed there because the Prophet considered that it had some value to the Church in regard to its teachings. There are some revelations still in possession of the Church which were not included. Some of these we can readily believe were not included because the inspiration of the Prophet was that it was not necessary, or because some of them had an application which was not intended for publication and to be sent to an unbelieving world."],["div",{"id":"p3","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-69-80/section-69-instructions-to-preserve-historical-records.p3"},"“The preparation for the printing was soon completed, but this took a great deal of the Prophet’s time from the first of November to the twelfth, and in that time there had been held four special conferences.

How many thousands have been miraculously healed in this Church, and yet no one has recorded the circumstances. Is this right? Should these miraculous manifestations of the power of God be forgotten and pass into oblivion? Should the knowledge of these things slumber in the hearts of those who witnessed them? … We should keep a record because Jesus has commanded it. We should keep a record because the same will benefit us and the generations of our children after us. We should keep a record because it will furnish many important items for the general history of the Church which would otherwise be lost.” (",["span.emphasis","Millennial Star,"],"15 May 1849, p. 152.)"],["div",{"id":"p9","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-69-80/section-69-instructions-to-preserve-historical-records.p9"},"When we consider the great events that lie in the future, we can see why the Saints are encouraged to keep personal histories and journals.
