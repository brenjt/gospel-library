He had spent a lifetime serving alongside faithful Latter-day Saint women. This service began in the late 1880s, when he was about 10 years old. At that time, Latter-day Saint women were encouraged to gain an education in medicine and health care. His mother, Julina L. Smith, followed this counsel and received training to serve as a midwife. She often awoke him in the middle of the night so he could drive their horse-drawn carriage to a home where a baby was about to be born. Serving with his mother in this way, young Joseph Fielding Smith saw an example of the strength and compassion of the women of the Church.",["sup",["a",{"href":"fn_2"},"2"]],"Sister Smith later served as a counselor in the Relief Society general presidency."],["p.para",{"id":"p7","uri":"/manual/teachings-of-presidents-of-the-church-joseph-fielding-smith/chapter-24-the-work-of-latter-day-saint-women-unselfish-devotion-to-this-glorious-cause.p7"},"President Smith had great respect for the Relief Society, which he said “is a vital part of the kingdom of God on earth.”",["sup",["a",{"href":"fn_3"},"3"]],"His second wife, Ethel, served as a member of the general Relief Society board for 21 years.

Jessie went with him almost every time he traveled to teach the Saints. She had a beautiful singing voice, and President Smith always wanted her to sing at the meetings they attended. Elder Francis M. Gibbons, who served as a secretary to the First Presidency, recounted: “Whenever Joseph Fielding presided, he wanted her to perform if for no other reason than that he never tired of hearing her sing. Beyond that, however, her well-trained contralto voice, singing sacred hymns, added a special touch of spirituality to the meetings, inspiring the listeners and elevating his own capabilities in delivering the spoken word. Later, through the persistent and playful urging of his wife, Joseph would occasionally join Jessie in a duet, blending his own fine baritone voice with hers. On these occasions, they would usually sit together on the piano bench while Jessie played the accompaniment, moderating her usual, full-throated voice so as not to drown out the singing of her husband.”",["sup",["a",{"href":"fn_6"},"6"]]],["p.para",{"id":"p9","uri":"/manual/teachings-of-presidents-of-the-church-joseph-fielding-smith/chapter-24-the-work-of-latter-day-saint-women-unselfish-devotion-to-this-glorious-cause.p9"},"As President of the Church, Joseph Fielding Smith regularly worked with Sister Belle S.
