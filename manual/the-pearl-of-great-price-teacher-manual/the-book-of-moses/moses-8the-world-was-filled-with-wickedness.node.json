Discuss the following statement by President Ezra Taft Benson: “There will be a new spirit in Zion when the young women will say to their boyfriends, ‘If you cannot get a temple recommend, then I am not about to tie my life to you, even for mortality!’ And the young returned missionary will say to his girlfriend, ‘I am sorry, but as much as I love you, I will not marry out of the holy temple.’” (“To the Young Women of the Church,”",["span.emphasis","Ensign,"],"Nov. 1986, 84)."]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.27"},"Moses 8:27"],".

(You may want to review “grace” in the Bible Dictionary.) Ask: Why did Noah find grace in the eyes of the Lord? How was the Flood an act of grace? (Answers might include that by sending the Flood the Lord stopped the people from committing further wickedness, or that it was an act of grace for the premortal spirits because if there had not been a Flood those spirits would not have had an opportunity to be born into righteous families [see also",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.24"},"2 Nephi 26:24"],"].) Tell students that the Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “As far as we degenerate from God, we descend to the devil and lose knowledge, and without knowledge we cannot be saved, and while our hearts are filled with evil, and we are studying evil, there is no room in our hearts for good, or studying good” (",["span.emphasis","Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,"],"217).
