Explain that Satan, or Lucifer, is a spirit son of God who rebelled against God and sought to destroy the agency of man and God’s plan of eternal happiness. Because of his rebellion he was cast out of the presence of God and sent to the earth without a body of flesh and blood. He and those who rebelled with him will never receive bodies nor become as God is, and are therefore miserable.

(These scriptures teach that Satan’s purposes are to deceive mankind, destroy the work of God, make war on the Saints of God, and make men miserable.)

Also explain that because there is so little information about Satan in the Old Testament, many people today challenge his reality. In the eight chapters of the book of Moses, however, Satan is referred to more than thirty times. Ask why the reference to Satan is found so few times in the Bible and so many times in the Pearl of Great Price, and discuss why it is important to know that Satan is real (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.19-21"},"2 Nephi 28:19–21"],")."]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.12"},"Moses 1:12"],". “Moses, Son of Man”"],["div",{"id":"p44","uri":"/manual/the-pearl-of-great-price-teacher-manual/the-book-of-moses/moses-112-23-satan-commanded-moses-to-worship-him.p44"},"Read",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.4,6-7,40"},"Moses 1:4, 6–7, 40"],"and review what God called Moses.
