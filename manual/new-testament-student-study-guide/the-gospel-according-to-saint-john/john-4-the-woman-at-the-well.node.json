When it was time to return to Galilee they went through a part of the country called Samaria (see accompanying map). The Samaritans and the Jews were not friendly toward one another. The Jews considered the Samaritans “unclean” (see Bible Dictionary,",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bd/samaritans"},"“Samaritans,”"],"p. 768). Sometimes a Jew would even travel a day or two out of his way to avoid Samaria. As you read",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/4"},"John 4"],", consider what Jesus taught about those traditions, both by what He said and by what He did.
