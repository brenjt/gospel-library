We need to extend the hand of friendship and resist the hand of retribution [revenge]. In short, we need to love one another with the pure love of Christ, with genuine charity and compassion and, if necessary, shared suffering, for that is the way God loves us” (“Come to the God of All Truth,”",["span.emphasis","Ensign,"],"Sept. 1994, 72)."]]],[".topic",["h2","Studying the Scriptures"],["p.para",{"id":"p282","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-john/john-13-love-one-another.p282"},"Do activities A and B as you study",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/13"},"John 13"],"."],[".topic",["h3",["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/icon-a.gif"}],"How Is It Different?
