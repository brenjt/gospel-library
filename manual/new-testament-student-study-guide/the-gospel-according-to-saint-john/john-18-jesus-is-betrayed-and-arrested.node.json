But it does provide important insights into Jesus’ arrest, His trial before Pilate, and Peter’s denial. It is also the only gospel that records Jesus’ trial before Annas (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/18.19-24"},"John 18:19–24"],"). Though it might appear that freedom and life were taken from Jesus, John testified that He knew “all things that should come upon him” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/john/18.4"},"John 18:4"],").
