Even the most faithful of God’s servants must endure hardship and trials. Paul suffered a great deal for the cause of Jesus Christ. After his return to Jerusalem after his third missionary journey, he was arrested and imprisoned for several years by Roman authorities. Through all of this the Lord sustained and protected him and gave him the opportunity to preach the gospel before kings and rulers."]],[".bodyBlock",[".topic",["h2","Understanding the Scriptures"],[".figure",{"id":"f76","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-21-23-paul-is-arrested-in-jerusalem.f76"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/21"},"Acts 21"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","Girdle"],"(v. 11)"],["td","Sash or cloth to wrap around the waist"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Zealous"],"(v. 20)"],["td","Eager, devoted"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Vow"],"(v. 23)"],["td","Special promise to demonstrate dedication to God"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Tumult"],"(v. 34)"],["td","Uproar, riot"],["td"]]]]],[".figure",{"id":"f77","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-21-23-paul-is-arrested-in-jerusalem.f77"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/22"},"Acts 22"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","This way"],"(v. 4)"],["td","Followers of Christ, Christians"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","In a trance"],"(v. 17)"],["td","Carried away in the Spirit"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Martyr"],"(v. 20)"],["td","Person killed for his beliefs"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Cast off their clothes"],"(v. 23)"],["td","Tore off their coats to demonstrate anger"],["td"]]]]],[".figure",{"id":"f78","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-21-23-paul-is-arrested-in-jerusalem.f78"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/23"},"Acts 23"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","Whited wall"],"(v. 3)"],["td","Wall painted to look clean; symbol for those who pretended to be good but were inwardly evil"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Dissension"],"(vv. 7, 10)"],["td","Disagreement, argument"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Conspiracy"],"(v. 13)"],["td","Plot or scheme to do evil"],["td"]]]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/23.24-35"},"Acts 23:24–35"],"—Who Was Felix?"],["p.para",{"id":"p321","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-21-23-paul-is-arrested-in-jerusalem.p321"},"Antonius Felix was a Roman who was appointed governor of the province of Judea.
