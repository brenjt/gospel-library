The Jews believed that the only way a Gentile (non-Israelite) could be acceptable to God was for that person to first become a Jew by submitting to all of the ordinances and requirements of the law of Moses."],[".intro","Peter had two experiences that dramatically changed the practice of the Church and a thousand years of Jewish tradition. Through a vision, he learned that God is truly “no respecter of persons” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/10.34"},"Acts 10:34"],"). Peter then had a remarkable meeting with some devout Gentiles. Until then it appears that all who had joined the Church were either Jews or were Gentiles who had previously been converted to Judaism. Peter was able to teach the people that the law of Moses had been completely fulfilled and that Gentiles could come directly into the Church without first becoming Jews."]],[".bodyBlock",[".topic",["h2","Understanding the Scriptures"],[".figure",{"id":"f37","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-10-the-gospel-is-for-everyone.f37"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/10"},"Acts 10"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","Centurion"],"(v. 1)"],["td","Roman military commander"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Ninth hour"],"(v. 3)"],["td","About 3:00",["span.small","P.M."]],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Alms"],"(v. 4)"],["td","Donations to the poor"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Sixth hour"],"(v. 9)"],["td","About noon"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Fell into a trance"],"(v. 10)"],["td","The Holy Spirit came upon him"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Common or unclean"],"(v. 14)"],["td","Forbidden by Mosaic law"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Accompanied"],"(v. 23)"],["td","Went with"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Gainsaying"],"(v. 29)"],["td","Objecting"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Perceive"],"(v. 34)"],["td","Understand"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","They of the circumcision"],"(v. 45)"],["td","Jewish converts to Christianity"],["td"]]]]],[".",{"id":"f38","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-10-the-gospel-is-for-everyone.f38"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-100-2.gif"}]],[".figure",{"id":"f39","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-10-the-gospel-is-for-everyone.f39"},[".caption",["p",{"id":"lds-"},["span.emphasis","Ninth hour"]]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/10"},"Acts 10"],"—A Modern Parallel"],["p.para",{"id":"p171","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-10-the-gospel-is-for-everyone.p171"},"Peter’s vision, teaching him that God is “no respecter of persons” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/10.34"},"Acts 10:34"],"), brought a major change in the Church.
