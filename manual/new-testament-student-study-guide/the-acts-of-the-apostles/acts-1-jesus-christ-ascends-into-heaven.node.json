Luke wanted his friend Theophilus to know that Jesus Christ rose from the dead and ascended (returned) into heaven—the greatest news the world has ever known. Luke described how the Savior had extended the call to the Apostles to carry the gospel into all the world before His Second Coming. After He ascended into Heaven, angels promised the Apostles that He would return in a future day in glory. The Apostles accepted the Lord’s call to spread the gospel and ordained Matthias as a new Apostle to replace Judas Iscariot. Imagine how Theophilus might have felt receiving such news from Luke."]],[".bodyBlock",[".",{"id":"f2","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-1-jesus-christ-ascends-into-heaven.f2"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-094-2.gif"}]],[".topic",["h2","Understanding the Scriptures"],[".figure",{"id":"f3","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-1-jesus-christ-ascends-into-heaven.f3"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/1"},"Acts 1"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","Treatise"],"(v. 1)"],["td","Writing"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Infallible"],"(v. 3)"],["td","Cannot be wrong"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","With one accord"],"(v. 14)"],["td","In unity"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Supplication"],"(v. 14)"],["td","Asking"],["td"]]]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/1.8"},"Acts 1:8"],"—An Outline for the Book of Acts"],["p.para",{"id":"p32","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-1-jesus-christ-ascends-into-heaven.p32"},"The command Jesus gave His Apostles to be witnesses for Him “in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth” forms a pattern or outline for the book of Acts:",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/1"},"Acts 1–7"],"records the preaching in Jerusalem,",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/8"},"Acts 8–9"],"reports the spreading of the gospel to Judea and Samaria, and",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/10"},"Acts 10–28"],"tells how the gospel began to be taken to the “uttermost part of the earth.” Remember this pattern as you read Acts."],[".",{"id":"f4","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-1-jesus-christ-ascends-into-heaven.f4"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-094-3.gif"}]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/1.18"},"Acts 1:18"],"—How Did Judas Die?"],["p.para",{"id":"p33","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-1-jesus-christ-ascends-into-heaven.p33"},["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/27.5"},"Matthew 27:5"],"and",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/1.18"},"Acts 1:18"],"give the impression that Matthew and Luke disagreed about how Judas died.
