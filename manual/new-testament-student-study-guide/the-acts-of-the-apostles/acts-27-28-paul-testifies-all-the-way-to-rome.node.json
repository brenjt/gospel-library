But Paul had requested to be tried before Caesar, so he was sent to Rome (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/26.31-32"},"Acts 26:31–32"],"). That might seem unfortunate to us, but it was actually a blessing for Paul. Had he been freed in Judea, the Jews would have continued to try to kill him. Also, the Lord had told Paul that he would “bear witness also at Rome” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/23.11"},"Acts 23:11"],"). Sending Paul to Rome as a prisoner of the empire was the safest way to get him there even though the journey was difficult. Paul faced many challenges while on the Lord’s errand, but he was also able to testify all the way to Rome. Notice the opportunities that came to Paul that he would not have had if the journey had been easier."]],[".bodyBlock",[".figure",{"id":"f95","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-27-28-paul-testifies-all-the-way-to-rome.f95"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-109-2.gif"}]],[".topic",["h2","Understanding the Scriptures"],[".figure",{"id":"f96","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-27-28-paul-testifies-all-the-way-to-rome.f96"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/27"},"Acts 27"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","Contrary"],"(v. 4)"],["td","Blowing in the wrong direction"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","The fast"],"(v. 9)"],["td","The day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Admonished"],"(v. 9)"],["td","Warned"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Commodious"],"(v. 12)"],["td","Comfortable, suitable"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Undergirding the ship"],"(v. 17)"],["td","Tying ropes under the ship"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Long abstinence"],"(v. 21)"],["td","Long time without food"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Sounded"],"(v. 28)"],["td","Dropped a rope to measure the depth of water"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Twenty fathoms"],"(v. 28)"],["td","100–120 feet (36.5 meters); one fathom is six feet (1.8 meters)"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Under colour"],"(v. 30)"],["td","Pretending"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Threescore"],"(v. 37)"],["td","Sixty; one score is twenty"],["td"]]]]],[".",{"id":"f97","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-27-28-paul-testifies-all-the-way-to-rome.f97"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-110-1.gif"}]],[".figure",{"id":"f98","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-27-28-paul-testifies-all-the-way-to-rome.f98"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/28"},"Acts 28"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","Melita"],"(v. 1)"],["td","Malta"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Barbarous people, barbarians"],"(vv. 2, 4)"],["td","Those people were called barbarous because they spoke neither Greek nor Latin, not because they were uncivilized."],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Viper"],"(v. 3)"],["td","Poisonous snake"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Vengeance"],"(v. 4)"],["td","God’s justice"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Laded"],"(v. 10)"],["td","Supplied"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Suffered"],"(v. 16)"],["td","Allowed, permitted"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Constrained"],"(v. 19)"],["td","Forced by circumstances, of necessity"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","This sect"],"(v. 22)"],["td","Christianity, the Church of Jesus Christ"],["td"]]]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/acts/28.30"},"Acts 28:30"],"—The Final Years of Paul’s Life"],["p.para",{"id":"p420","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-acts-of-the-apostles/acts-27-28-paul-testifies-all-the-way-to-rome.p420"},"We learn from other sources that Paul was tried and released after two years in Rome.
