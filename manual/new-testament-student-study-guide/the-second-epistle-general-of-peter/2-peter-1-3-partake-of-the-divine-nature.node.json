With the Lord’s help, we must change and grow to be “partakers of the divine nature” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.4"},"2 Peter 1:4"],"). Some people, however, choose to follow a different course in life, one that will not lead to the celestial kingdom. Elder Russell M. Nelson, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, described such people as having “climbed their ladder of learning, only to find it leaning against the wrong wall” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1984, 37; or Ensign, Nov. 1984, 30). As you read 2 Peter, look for the steps the Lord asked us to follow and how we can protect ourselves from false teachers who would lead us down a wrong path."]],[".bodyBlock",[".",{"id":"f1","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-second-epistle-general-of-peter/2-peter-1-3-partake-of-the-divine-nature.f1"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-159-1.gif"}]],[".topic",["h2","Understanding the Scriptures"],[".figure",{"id":"f2","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-second-epistle-general-of-peter/2-peter-1-3-partake-of-the-divine-nature.f2"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1"},"2 Peter 1"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","Divine"],"(vv. 3–4)"],["td","Godly"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Pertain unto"],"(v. 3)"],["td","Have to do with"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Unfruitful"],"(v. 8)"],["td","Empty"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Purged"],"(v. 9)"],["td","Cleansed"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","In this tabernacle"],"(v. 13)"],["td","Alive, in this body"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Cunningly devised fables"],"(v. 16)"],["td","Clever and false stories designed to deceive people"],["td"]]]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.10"},"2 Peter 1:10"],"—“Make Your Calling and Election Sure”"],["p.para",{"id":"p10","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-second-epistle-general-of-peter/2-peter-1-3-partake-of-the-divine-nature.p10"},"Elder Bruce R.
