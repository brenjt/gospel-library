Talmage wrote: “There was no reproof of Martha’s desire to provide well; nor any sanction of possible neglect on Mary’s part. We must suppose that Mary had been a willing helper before the master’s arrival; but now that He had come, she chose to remain with Him. Had she been culpably neglectful of her duty, Jesus would not have commended her course. He desired not well-served meals and material comforts only, but the company of the sisters, and above all their receptive attention to what He had to say. He had more to give them than they could possibly provide for Him. Jesus loved the two sisters and their brother as well. Both these women were devoted to Jesus, and each expressed herself in her own way. Martha was of a practical turn, concerned in material service; she was by nature hospitable and self-denying. Mary, contemplative and more spiritually inclined, showed her devotion through the service of companionship and appreciation” (",["span.emphasis","Jesus the Christ,"],"433)."]]],[".",{"id":"f39","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-luke/luke-10-the-seventy-are-sent-out-to-preach.f39"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-061-1.gif"}]],[".topic",["h2","Studying the Scriptures"],["p.para",{"id":"p268","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-luke/luke-10-the-seventy-are-sent-out-to-preach.p268"},"Do two of the following activities (A–C) as you study",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/10"},"Luke 10"],"."],[".topic",["h3",["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/icon-a.gif"}],"The Mission of the Seventy"],[".figure",{"id":"f40","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-luke/luke-10-the-seventy-are-sent-out-to-preach.f40"},["ol.number",["li",["span.label","1."],["p.para","Read",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/10.1-24"},"Luke 10:1–24"],"and list ways the mission of the Seventy was similar to the mission of the Twelve Apostles, as recorded in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/9.1-6,10"},"Luke 9:1–6, 10"],".
