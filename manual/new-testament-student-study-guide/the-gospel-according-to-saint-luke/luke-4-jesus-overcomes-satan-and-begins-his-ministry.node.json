Why? What did the devil hope to gain? Heavenly Father desires that all of His children enjoy “immortality and eternal life” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39"},"Moses 1:39"],"). Satan desires that “all men might be miserable like unto himself” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27"},"2 Nephi 2:27"],"; see also",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.18"},"v. 18"],").
