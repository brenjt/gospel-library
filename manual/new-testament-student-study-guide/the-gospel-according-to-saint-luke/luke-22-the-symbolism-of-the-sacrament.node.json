This symbolized the infinite and eternal sacrifice that was carried out because of the Savior’s love for us. As you read Luke’s testimony of what happened in that upper room and in Gethsemane, consider how important the Atonement is in your life. How blessed are you because of Jesus’ sacrifice? How does partaking of the sacrament help you build faith in the Atonement of Jesus Christ and increase your testimony of Him as your Savior and Redeemer?"]],[".bodyBlock",[".topic",["h2","Other Accounts of What You Read in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/22"},"Luke 22"]],["p.para",{"id":"p545","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-luke/luke-22-the-symbolism-of-the-sacrament.p545"},["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/22.1-65"},"Luke 22:1–65"],"—",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/26"},"Matthew 26"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/14"},"Mark 14"]],["p.para",{"id":"p546","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-luke/luke-22-the-symbolism-of-the-sacrament.p546"},["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/22.66-71"},"Luke 22:66–71"],"—",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/27.1"},"Matthew 27:1"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/15.1"},"Mark 15:1"]]],[".topic",["h2","Understanding the Scriptures"],[".figure",{"id":"f82","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-luke/luke-22-the-symbolism-of-the-sacrament.f82"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/22"},"Luke 22"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","Strife"],"(v. 24)"],["td","Argument"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Exercise lordship over them"],"(v. 25)"],["td","Rule over them"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Benefactors"],"(v. 25)"],["td","Virtuous, upright, the best of persons"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Thrice"],"(v. 34)"],["td","Three times"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Purse and scrip"],"(vv. 35–36)"],["td","Money bag or sack to put possessions in"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Suffer ye thus far"],"(v. 51)"],["td","Stop this, there will be no more of this"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Things blasphemously"],"(v. 65)"],["td","Insulting things"],["td"]]]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/22.31-34,54-62"},"Luke 22:31–34, 54–62"],"—Peter Denies Jesus"],[".",{"id":"f83","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-luke/luke-22-the-symbolism-of-the-sacrament.f83"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-071-2.gif"}]],["p.para",{"id":"p554","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-luke/luke-22-the-symbolism-of-the-sacrament.p554"},"In a talk entitled",["span.emphasis","Peter, My Brother,"],"Elder Spencer W.
