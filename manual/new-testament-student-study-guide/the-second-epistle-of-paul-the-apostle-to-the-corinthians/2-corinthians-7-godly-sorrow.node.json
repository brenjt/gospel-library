Sometimes this is because their actions cause them or loved ones great sorrow and misery. Sometimes their sorrow is caused because they are caught and punished for their actions. Such worldly feelings do not constitute ‘godly sorrow’ (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/2-cor/7.10"},"2 Corinthians 7:10"],"). Godly sorrow is a gift of the Spirit. It is a deep realization that our actions have offended our Father and our God. It is the sharp and keen awareness that our behavior caused the Savior, He who knew no sin, even the greatest of all, to endure agony and suffering. Our sins caused Him to bleed at every pore. This very real mental and spiritual anguish is what the scriptures refer to as having ‘a broken heart and contrite spirit’ (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37"},"D&C 20:37"],"). Such a spirit is the absolute prerequisite for true repentance” (",["span.emphasis","The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson,"],"72)."]],[".bodyBlock",[".",{"id":"f14","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-second-epistle-of-paul-the-apostle-to-the-corinthians/2-corinthians-7-godly-sorrow.f14"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-129-1.gif"}]],[".topic",["p.para",{"id":"p57","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-second-epistle-of-paul-the-apostle-to-the-corinthians/2-corinthians-7-godly-sorrow.p57"},"Understanding the Scriptures"],[".figure",{"id":"f15","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-second-epistle-of-paul-the-apostle-to-the-corinthians/2-corinthians-7-godly-sorrow.f15"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/2-cor/7"},"2 Corinthians 7"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","Vehement"],"(v. 11)"],["td","Earnest desire"],["td"]]]]]],[".topic",["h2","Studying the Scriptures"],["p.para",{"id":"p59","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-second-epistle-of-paul-the-apostle-to-the-corinthians/2-corinthians-7-godly-sorrow.p59"},"Do the following activity as you study",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/2-cor/7"},"2 Corinthians 7"],"."],[".topic",["h3",["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/icon-a.gif"}],"Give Your Advice"],["p.para",{"id":"p60","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-second-epistle-of-paul-the-apostle-to-the-corinthians/2-corinthians-7-godly-sorrow.p60"},"Study",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/2-cor/7.8-11"},"2 Corinthians 7:8–11"],"and the quote from President Ezra Taft Benson in the preceding introduction.
