He accomplished this mission by (1) preaching the true spirit and meaning of the law of Moses; (2) teaching people to repent, to be baptized, and to prepare to receive further truth and blessings from the coming Messiah; and (3) testifying that Jesus Christ was that promised Messiah. Apparently, some of John’s followers who were very loyal to him were still not sure if Jesus really was the Messiah, or Christ. True prophets always point us toward Christ and encourage us to come unto Him. Look for what John did to help his followers find Jesus and follow Him instead."],[".intro",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/11"},"Matthew 11"],"also contains one of the great invitations the Savior Himself made to come unto Him."]],[".bodyBlock",[".topic",[".",{"id":"f50","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-11-come-unto-me.f50"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-019-1.gif"}],[".caption",["p",{"id":"lds-"},["span.emphasis","John the Baptist—more than a prophet"]]]],["h2","Other Accounts of What You Read in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/11"},"Matthew 11"]],["p.para",{"id":"p358","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-11-come-unto-me.p358"},["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/11.2-19"},"Matthew 11:2–19"],"—",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/7.18-35"},"Luke 7:18–35"]],["p.para",{"id":"p359","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-11-come-unto-me.p359"},["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/11.20-24"},"Matthew 11:20–24"],"—",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/10.12-15"},"Luke 10:12–15"]],["p.para",{"id":"p360","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-11-come-unto-me.p360"},["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/11.25-27"},"Matthew 11:25–27"],"—",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/luke/10.21-22"},"Luke 10:21–22"]]],[".topic",["h2","Understanding the Scriptures"],[".figure",{"id":"f51","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-11-come-unto-me.f51"},["p"],["h2",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/11"},"Matthew 11"]],["p"],["table",["tbody",["tr",["td",["b","Shew"],"(v. 4)"],["td","Show"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Offended in me"],"(v. 6)"],["td","Ashamed of things I do or say"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","He that is least in the kingdom of heaven"],"(v. 11)"],["td","He whom you (the religious leaders) consider the least important; Jesus was referring to Himself"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Suffereth violence"],"(v. 12)"],["td","Experiences persecution and opposition"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Elias"],"(v. 14)"],["td","Elijah (Greek form of the Hebrew name; see Bible Dictionary,",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bd/elias"},"“Elias,”"],"p. 663)"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Liken"],"(v. 16)"],["td","Compare"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Lamented"],"(v. 17)"],["td","Been sorry"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Gluttonous"],"(v. 19)"],["td","Someone who eats and drinks too much"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Winebibber"],"(v. 19)"],["td","One who drinks too much wine"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Justified of her children"],"(v. 19)"],["td","Proved true by works or deeds"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Upbraid"],"(v. 20)"],["td","Criticize, scold"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Woe"],"(v. 21)"],["td","Warning"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Sackcloth and ashes"],"(v. 21)"],["td","The Jewish people put on clothes made of coarse fabric woven from the hair of camels or goats and put ashes on their head as a sign that they were mourning or repenting."],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Tolerable"],"(vv. 22, 24)"],["td","Better (less punishment)"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Exalted unto heaven"],"(v. 23)"],["td","Filled with pride"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Labour"],"(v. 28)"],["td","Work very hard"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Heavy laden"],"(v. 28)"],["td","Carry heavy loads"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Yoke"],"(vv. 29–30)"],["td","A wooden frame used by cattle or people to make it easier to carry loads or burdens"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["p.para",{"id":"lip","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-11-come-unto-me.lip"}],[".",{"id":"f52","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-11-come-unto-me.f52"},["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/p-020-1.gif"}],[".caption",["p",{"id":"lds-"},["span.emphasis","Yoke for cattle"]]]],["p"]],["td"],["td"]],["tr",["td",["b","Burden"],"(v. 30)"],["td","Something a person carries; obligations"],["td"]]]]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/11.7-11"},"Matthew 11:7–11"],"—“Among Them That Are Born of Women There Hath Not Risen a Greater Than John the Baptist”"],["p.para",{"id":"p382","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-11-come-unto-me.p382"},"The Prophet Joseph Smith said:"],["p.para",{"id":"p383","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-11-come-unto-me.p383"},"“How is it that John was considered one of the greatest prophets?
