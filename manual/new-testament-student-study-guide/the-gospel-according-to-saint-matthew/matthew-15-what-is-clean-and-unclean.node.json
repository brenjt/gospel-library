Although the leaders’ intentions were good, these additions eventually became more important to the Jews than the law itself—certainly more important than the spirit of the law. One of these additions to the law involved ceremonial washings before eating a meal. It was not simply washing for health reasons, but there were specific ways to wash determined by Jewish leaders. When the disciples of Jesus were accused of breaking this tradition of the elders, Jesus used it as a teaching opportunity. As you read, look for what Jesus said were the true principles the Jews had missed by concentrating on their traditions.
