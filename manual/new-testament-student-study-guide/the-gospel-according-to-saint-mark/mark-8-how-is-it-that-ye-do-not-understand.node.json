When a little leaven is mixed with bread dough it quickly affects all of the dough, creating bubbles and causing the bread to rise. Bread made with yeast (leavened bread) is lighter than unleavened bread, but it spoils more quickly. For this reason leaven, in scripture, is sometimes a symbol for corruption. That is what Jesus meant when he said, “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.” At other times leaven refers to how a small amount of whatever is being spoken about can influence a large amount of something else for good or evil."]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/8.29-30"},"Mark 8:29–30"],"—Why Did Jesus Not Want His Disciples to Tell Anyone He Was the Christ?"],["p.para",{"id":"p203","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-mark/mark-8-how-is-it-that-ye-do-not-understand.p203"},"See “Understanding the Scriptures” for",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/16.20"},"Matthew 16:20"],"(p. 24)."]]],[".topic",["h2","Studying the Scriptures"],["p.para",{"id":"p204","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-mark/mark-8-how-is-it-that-ye-do-not-understand.p204"},"Do activity A as you study",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/8"},"Mark 8"],"."],[".topic",["h3",["img",{"src":"http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/gospel-library/manual/34188/icon-a.gif"}],"Same and Different"],[".figure",{"id":"f32","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-mark/mark-8-how-is-it-that-ye-do-not-understand.f32"},["ol.number",["li",["span.label","1."],["p.para","List the ways the miracle described in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/8.22-26"},"Mark 8:22–26"],"is either the same as or different from other miracles you have read about in the New Testament (for example, compare",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/matt/20.30-34"},"Matthew 20:30–34"],")."]],["li",["span.label","2."],["p.para","What spiritual message could you learn from the miracle recorded in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/mark/8.22-26"},"Mark 8:22–26"],"?"]]]]]]]]]],"refs":null}
