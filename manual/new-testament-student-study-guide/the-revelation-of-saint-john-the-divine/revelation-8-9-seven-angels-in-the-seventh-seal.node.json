First, we read that the judgments of the fifth angel only came upon those who “have not the seal of God in their foreheads” (v. 4), which emphasizes again the spiritual—and often physical—protection provided by obedience to the ordinances of the gospel. The second thing of note is that although the Lord sent these destructions to encourage people to repent (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43.20-25"},"D&C 43:20–25"],"), after six angels had “sounded” their judgment, the wicked were still not convinced to repent (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/rev/9.20-21"},"Revelation 9:20–21"],"). As in the days of Noah and the last years of the Nephites in the Book of Mormon, the people apparently became so wicked that repentance was nearly impossible."],[".intro","There are many symbolic images in",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/rev/8"},"Revelation 8–9"],".
