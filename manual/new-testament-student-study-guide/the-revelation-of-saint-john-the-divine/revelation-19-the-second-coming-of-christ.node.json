The other supper, “the supper of the great God” (v. 17), is a symbol that reminds us of the destruction of the wicked. Furthermore, it reminds us that if we put our trust in the things of this world and refuse to believe in life after death, the only future we will look forward to is the same as all other living things on earth—we will die, begin to rot, and birds of prey will eat our flesh.
