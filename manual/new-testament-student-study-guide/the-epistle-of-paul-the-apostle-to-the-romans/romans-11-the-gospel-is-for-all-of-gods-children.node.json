McConkie taught the following about the “fulness of the Gentiles”: “For the nearly two thousand years between Abraham and Christ, the statutes and judgments of God were reserved almost exclusively for the seed of Abraham and for the house of Israel. During the mortal ministry of our Lord, the message was limited to Israel, to the Jews, and it was not then offered to the Gentiles. After Jesus’ resurrection, Peter opened the door to the preaching of the gospel of the Gentiles, and Paul became their chief apostolic advocate and teacher. Thus there was a period or time appointed for the Jews to hear the word, and then a period of time for the Gentiles to take precedence. The times of the Gentiles is the period during which the gospel goes to them on a preferential basis, and this will continue until they have had a full opportunity to accept the truth, or in other words until the fulness of the Gentiles. Then the message will go again to the Jews, meaning to the Jews as a nation and as a people” (",["span.emphasis","Doctrinal New Testament Commentary,"],"2:290)."]],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/nt/rom/11.1-5"},"Romans 11:1–5"],"—The Election of Grace"],["p.para",{"id":"p108","uri":"/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-epistle-of-paul-the-apostle-to-the-romans/romans-11-the-gospel-is-for-all-of-gods-children.p108"},"Heavenly Father’s plan requires that all of His children have an opportunity to accept or reject the gospel.
