Nephi’s insights about Isaiah’s prophecies can be summarized in three categories. First, he affirmed the role of Jesus Christ as the sole source of salvation. Second, he warned readers in the last days of great evils: pride, priestcraft, and secret combinations. Third, he quoted an additional prophecy from Isaiah, highlighting the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the coming forth of the Book of Mormon.
