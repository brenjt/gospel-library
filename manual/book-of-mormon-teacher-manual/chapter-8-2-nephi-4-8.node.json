They were scattered because they turned from the Lord, worshipped false gods, and walked in all the ways of the heathen nations. They were scattered because they forsook the Abrahamic covenant, trampled under their feet the holy ordinances, and rejected the Lord Jehovah, who is the Lord Jesus, of whom all their prophets testified. Israel was scattered for apostasy. The Lord in his wrath, because of their wickedness and rebellion, scattered them among the heathen in all the nations of the earth."],["div",{"id":"p109","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-teacher-manual/chapter-8-2-nephi-4-8.p109"},"“What, then, is involved in the gathering of Israel? The gathering of Israel consists in believing and accepting and living in harmony with all that the Lord once offered his ancient chosen people. It consists of having faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, of repenting, of being baptized and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and of keeping the commandments of God. It consists of believing the gospel, joining the Church, and coming into the kingdom. It consists of receiving the holy priesthood, being endowed in holy places with power from on high, and receiving all the blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, through the ordinance of celestial marriage” (",["span.emphasis","A New Witness for the Articles of Faith"],"[1985], 515)."]],["div",{"id":"p110","uri":"/manual/book-of-mormon-teacher-manual/chapter-8-2-nephi-4-8.p110"},"Bear testimony of the gathering of Israel, of our opportunity to be gathered to the Savior as members of His Church, and of our opportunity to help others gather as well."]]]]]],"refs":null}
