But these chapters include many rich insights that can be valuable for those you teach. In many ways, your students are under attack from the forces of evil. As they study these chapters, they can learn from great examples, such as Captain Moroni, Pahoran, and Helaman and his young soldiers—lessons that will help them stay safe and secure. They will learn the price of contention and the power of righteous unity. They will see the result of keeping covenants and the blessings that can flow from being true in whatever circumstances they face. They will see the blessings of gospel-centered homes. They will gain increased appreciation for the Lord’s closeness to His chosen servants in times of difficulty and trial."]],[".topic",["h2","Some Doctrines and Principles"],["ul.bullet",["li",["span.label","•"],[".para","Keeping covenants leads to God’s blessings and protection (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.10-18"},"Alma 53:10–18"],")."]],["li",["span.label","•"],[".para","The Lord’s disciples are true in whatever they are trusted to do (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.16-23"},"Alma 53:16–23"],";",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/57.19-27"},"57:19–27"],")."]],["li",["span.label","•"],[".para","God grants hope, faith, peace, and assurances of deliverance to the righteous (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/58.1-12"},"Alma 58:1–12"],")."]],["li",["span.label","•"],[".para","The Lord expects us to defend freedom (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/60"},"Alma 60–61"],")."]]]],[".topic",["h2","Suggestions for Teaching"],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.4-5"},"Alma 53:4–5"],".
