After returning “speedily” to the city (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/alma/8.18"},"Alma 8:18"],"), he met Amulek, whom the Lord had prepared as a missionary companion for Alma. Alma and Amulek responded to the hard-heartedness of the people by teaching powerful doctrines concerning the plan of redemption, Resurrection, and Judgment.
