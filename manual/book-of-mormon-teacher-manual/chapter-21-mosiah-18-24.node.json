He and his new followers escaped to a place called Mormon, where they received the ordinance of baptism and became unified in their faith. They settled peacefully in a land they called Helam, but they were taken captive by Amulon, a former priest of King Noah who had joined the Lamanites. Just before this, the people who remained in the land of Lehi-Nephi, who were now led by King Noah’s righteous son Limhi, were also placed in bondage by the Lamanites. Both groups came to know that “none could deliver them but the Lord their God” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/23.23"},"Mosiah 23:23"],").
