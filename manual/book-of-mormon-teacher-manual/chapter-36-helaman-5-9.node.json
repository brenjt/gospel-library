They also tell of the strength that came to people who remained righteous, true, and faithful to Heavenly Father even when others overwhelmingly disregarded the commandments and the principles of salvation.

They can see that it is possible to live the gospel and love Heavenly Father even when they are surrounded by the influences of the world.
