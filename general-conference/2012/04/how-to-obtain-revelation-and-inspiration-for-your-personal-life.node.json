I’m grateful that that same support can come from a beloved companion on the other side of the veil. Thank you, Jeanene."],["div",{"id":"p6","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p6"},"The Holy Ghost communicates important information that we need to guide us in our mortal journey. When it is crisp and clear and essential, it warrants the title of revelation. When it is a series of promptings we often have to guide us step by step to a worthy objective, for the purpose of this message, it is inspiration."],["div",{"id":"p7","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p7"},"An example of revelation would be the direction that President Spencer W.

Smith: “I believe we move and have our being in the presence of heavenly messengers and of heavenly beings. We are not separate from them. … We are closely related to our kindred, to our ancestors … who have preceded us into the spirit world. We can not forget them; we do not cease to love them; we always hold them in our hearts, in memory, and thus we are associated and united to them by ties that we can not break. … If this is the case with us in our finite condition, surrounded by our mortal weaknesses, … how much more certain it is … to believe that those who have been faithful, who have gone beyond … can see us better than we can see them; that they know us better than we know them. … We live in their presence, they see us, they are solicitous for our welfare, they love us now more than ever. For now they see the dangers that beset us; … their love for us and their desire for our well being must be greater than that which we feel for ourselves.”",["sup",["a",{"href":"fn_1"},"1"]]],["div",{"id":"p9","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p9"},"Relationships can be strengthened through the veil with people we know and love. That is done by our determined effort to continually do what is right. We can strengthen our relationship with the departed individual we love by recognizing that the separation is temporary and that covenants made in the temple are eternal. When consistently obeyed, such covenants assure the eternal realization of the promises inherent in them."],["div",{"id":"p10","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p10"},"A very clear case of revelation in my life occurred when I was strongly prompted by the Spirit to ask Jeanene Watkins to be sealed to me in the temple."],["div",{"id":"p11","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p11"},"One of the great lessons that each of us needs to learn is to ask. Why does the Lord want us to pray to Him and to ask?

I fast. I pray to find and understand scriptures that will be helpful. That process is cyclical. I start reading a passage of scripture; I ponder what the verse means and pray for inspiration. I then ponder and pray to know if I have captured all the Lord wants me to do. Often more impressions come with increased understanding of doctrine. I have found that pattern to be a good way to learn from the scriptures."],["div",{"id":"p13","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p13"},"There are some practical principles that enhance revelation. First, yielding to emotions such as anger or hurt or defensiveness will drive away the Holy Ghost. Those emotions must be eliminated, or our chance for receiving revelation is slight."],["div",{"id":"p14","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p14"},"Another principle is to be cautious with humor. Loud, inappropriate laughter will offend the Spirit. A good sense of humor helps revelation; loud laughter does not. A sense of humor is an escape valve for the pressures of life."],["div",{"id":"p15","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p15"},"Another enemy to revelation comes from exaggeration or loudness in what is stated. Careful, quiet speech will favor the receipt of revelation."],["div",{"id":"p16","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p16"},"On the other hand, spiritual communication can be enhanced by good health practices. Exercise, reasonable amounts of sleep, and good eating habits increase our capacity to receive and understand revelation. We will live for our appointed life span. However, we can improve both the quality of our service and our well-being by making careful, appropriate choices."],["div",{"id":"p17","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p17"},"It is important that our daily activities do not distract us from listening to the Spirit."],["div",{"id":"p18","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p18"},"Revelation can also be given in a dream when there is an almost imperceptible transition from sleep to wakefulness. If you strive to capture the content immediately, you can record great detail, but otherwise it fades rapidly. Inspired communication in the night is generally accompanied by a sacred feeling for the entire experience. The Lord uses individuals for whom we have great respect to teach us truths in a dream because we trust them and will listen to their counsel. It is the Lord doing the teaching through the Holy Ghost. However, He may in a dream make it both easier to understand and more likely to touch our hearts by teaching us through someone we love and respect."],["div",{"id":"p19","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p19"},"When it is for the Lord’s purposes, He can bring anything to our remembrance. That should not weaken our determination to record impressions of the Spirit. Inspiration carefully recorded shows God that His communications are sacred to us. Recording will also enhance our ability to recall revelation. Such recording of direction of the Spirit should be protected from loss or intrusion by others."],["div",{"id":"p20","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p20"},"The scriptures give eloquent confirmation of how truth, consistently lived, opens the door to inspiration to know what to do and, where needed, to have personal capacities enhanced by divine power. The scriptures depict how an individual’s capacity to conquer difficulty, doubt, and seemingly insurmountable challenges is strengthened by the Lord in time of need. As you ponder such examples, there will come a quiet confirmation through the Holy Spirit that their experiences are true. You will come to know that similar help is available to you."],["div",{"id":"p21","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p21"},"I have seen individuals encountering challenges who knew what to do when it was beyond their own experience because they trusted in the Lord and knew that He would guide them to solutions that were urgently required."],["div",{"id":"p22","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p22"},"The Lord has declared: “And ye are to be taught from on high.

It gives access to divine power to accomplish what must be done. An individual motivated by a desire for praise or recognition will not qualify to be taught by the Spirit. An individual who is arrogant or who lets his or her emotions influence decisions will not be powerfully led by the Spirit."],["div",{"id":"p26","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/how-to-obtain-revelation-and-inspiration-for-your-personal-life.p26"},"When we are acting as instruments in behalf of others, we are more easily inspired than when we think only of ourselves.

It may seem paradoxical, but that is why recognizing answers to prayer can sometimes be very difficult. Sometimes we unwisely try to face life by depending on our own experience and capacity.
