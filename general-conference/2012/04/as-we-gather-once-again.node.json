We meet each six months to strengthen one another, to extend encouragement, to provide comfort, to build faith. We are here to learn. Some of you may be seeking answers to questions and challenges you are experiencing in your life. Some are struggling with disappointments or losses. Each can be enlightened and uplifted and comforted as the Spirit of the Lord is felt."],["div",{"id":"p5","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/as-we-gather-once-again.p5"},"Should there be changes which need to be made in your life, may you find the incentive and the courage to do so as you listen to the inspired words which will be spoken.

Despite what comes, this great cause will go forward. You recall the prophetic words of the Prophet Joseph Smith: “No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.”",["sup",["a",{"href":"fn_1"},"1"]]],["div",{"id":"p8","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/as-we-gather-once-again.p8"},"There is much that is difficult and challenging in the world today, my brothers and sisters, but there is also much that is good and uplifting.
