A vital part of the plan is our earthly experience—a time to develop faith (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.26"},"Moroni 7:26"],"), to repent (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.12"},"Mosiah 3:12"],"), and to reconcile ourselves with God (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.11"},"Jacob 4:11"],")."],["div",{"id":"p7","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/converted-to-his-gospel-through-his-church.p7"},"Because our mortal frailties and “opposition in all things” (",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11"},"2 Nephi 2:11"],") would make this life profoundly difficult and because we could not cleanse our own sins, a Savior was needed.

Its organization, effectiveness, and sheer goodness are respected by all who sincerely seek to understand it. The Church has programs for children, youth, men, and women. It has beautiful meetinghouses that number more than 18,000. Majestic temples—now totaling 136—dot the earth, with another 30 under construction or announced. A full-time missionary force of over 56,000, comprised of the young and less so, are serving in 150 countries. The Church’s worldwide humanitarian work is a marvelous display of the generosity of our members. Our welfare system cares for our members and promotes self-reliance in a manner unduplicated anywhere. In this Church we have selfless lay leaders and a community of Saints who are willing to serve one another in a remarkable way. There is nothing like this Church in all the world."],["div",{"id":"p11","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/converted-to-his-gospel-through-his-church.p11"},"When I was born, our family lived in a tiny cottage on the grounds of one of the great and historic meetinghouses of the Church, the Honolulu Tabernacle. I now apologize to my dear friends in the Presiding Bishopric, who oversee the facilities of the Church, but as a boy I climbed over and under and through every inch of that property, from the bottom of the water-filled reflecting pool to the top of the inside of the imposing lighted steeple. We even swung (Tarzan-like) on the long hanging vines of the huge banyan trees that are on the site."],["div",{"id":"p12","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/converted-to-his-gospel-through-his-church.p12"},"The Church was everything to us. We went to lots of meetings, even more than we have today. We attended Primary on Thursday afternoons. Relief Society meetings were on Tuesday mornings. Mutual for the youth was Wednesday night. Saturday was for ward activities. On Sunday, men and young men would go to priesthood meeting in the morning. Midday we would attend Sunday School. Then in the evening we returned for sacrament meeting. With comings and goings and meetings, it seemed our time was consumed with Church activities all day Sunday and most other days of the week."],["span.story",["div",{"id":"p13","uri":"/general-conference/2012/04/converted-to-his-gospel-through-his-church.p13"},"As much as I loved the Church, it was during those boyhood days that, for the first time, I had a sense there was something even more. When I was five years old, a major conference was held at the tabernacle. We walked down the lane on which we lived and over a small bridge leading to the stately meetinghouse and sat on about the 10th row in the large chapel. Presiding and speaking at the meeting was David O. McKay, the President of the Church. I do not recall anything he said, but I vividly remember what I saw and what I felt. President McKay was dressed in a cream-colored suit and, with his wavy white hair, looked very regal. In the tradition of the islands, he wore a triple-thick red carnation lei. As he spoke, I felt something quite intense and very personal. I later understood that I was feeling the influence of the Holy Spirit.

Therein lies a danger. It is possible to be active in the Church and less active in the gospel. Let me stress: activity in the Church is a highly desirable goal; however, it is insufficient.
