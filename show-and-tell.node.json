The coach had practices on Sundays. I remembered My Gospel Standards and told the coach I could not come. Unfortunately, my coach was not understanding. During the season I batted twelfth in the lineup because I missed Sunday practices. This made me sad, but my parents told me to work hard at the other practices and games. By the end of the season I was batting sixth in the lineup. I know Heavenly Father blessed me for keeping the Sabbath day holy. My team made it to the semifinals, but the game was on Sunday. I again chose to miss the game.
