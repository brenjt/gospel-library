My friend accidentally knocked it over and broke it. I was very sad. My friend also made a football field, so my teacher asked him to give me his. He had been so excited to show his parents that I said, “No, you can keep it.” He said he was sorry, and I forgave him. It made me feel good to forgive because that’s what Jesus would want me to do."],[".bio",["div",{"id":"p3","uri":"/friend/2013/04/show-and-tell.p3"},"William S., age 8, Texas, USA"]]],[".quote",{"id":"f2","uri":"/friend/2013/04/show-and-tell.f2"},["div",{"id":"p4","uri":"/friend/2013/04/show-and-tell.p4"},"I am looking forward to getting baptized.
