When problems come and questions arise, do not start your quest for faith by saying how much you do",["span.emphasis","not"],"have, leading as it were with your “unbelief.” That is like trying to stuff a turkey through the beak! Let me be clear on this point: I am not asking you to pretend to faith you do not have. I",["span.emphasis","am"],"asking you to be true to the faith you",["span.emphasis","do"],"have. Sometimes we act as if an honest declaration of doubt is a higher manifestation of moral courage than is an honest declaration of faith. It is not!
