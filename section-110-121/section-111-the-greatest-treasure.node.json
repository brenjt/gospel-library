In addition, the troubles in Zion (Missouri) had also heavily taxed the spiritual and temporal resources of the Church, which was barely six years old at this time. Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Oliver Cowdery, and Hyrum Smith left Kirtland in late July and traveled to Salem, Massachusetts. They rented a house, preached publicly, and went from house to house to teach the gospel.

There came to Kirtland a brother by the name of Burgess who stated that he had knowledge of a large amount of money secreted in the cellar of a certain house in Salem, Massachusetts, which had belonged to a widow (then deceased), and thought he was the only person who had knowledge of it, or of the location of the house. The brethren accepting the representations of Burgess as true made the journey to Salem to secure, if possible, the treasure. Burgess, according to Robinson, met the brethren in Salem, but claimed that time had wrought such changes in the town that he could not for a certainty point out the house ‘and soon left.’” (",["span.emphasis","Comprehensive History of the Church,"],"1:411.)"]],[".topic",["h2","Notes and Commentary"],[".topic",["h3",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/111.1-6"},"D&C 111:1–6"],". “I … Am Not Displeased … Notwithstanding Your Follies”"],["div",{"id":"p37","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-110-121/section-111-the-greatest-treasure.p37"},"The Prophet Joseph Smith’s motives for following William Burgess’s suggestion to search for the hidden treasure in Salem were good, prompted by his love for the Saints and for the Church. It appeared that in one incredible stroke of good fortune the Church could gain money enough to clear itself of its debts and care for the suffering Saints in Kirtland and Zion. The leading elders had no thought of personal gain in the trip.

At that time Church members were told that if they would humble themselves and seek through diligence and the prayer of faith to be relieved of their indebtedness, the Lord would send means for their deliverance. Now, still deeply in debt, Church leaders were trying to solve the financial difficulties of the Church through their own efforts. The Lord reminded them that He could give them power to pay their debts and that He would deal mercifully with Zion (see",["a.scriptureRef",{"href":"/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/111.5-6"},"D&C 111:5–6"],")."],["div",{"id":"p39","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-110-121/section-111-the-greatest-treasure.p39"},"Occasionally Church members with financial difficulties are tempted to seek relief in highly speculative investments.

Though I felt anxious to go home in the fall and thought it would involve what little property I had in the West in a difficulty to stay I felt willing to do the will of the Lord. I prayed earnestly to know his will and his spirit continually whispered to go to Salem. … The conference also voted that I should go and promised their prayers in my behalf that God might open an effectual door for the word.” (Journal of Erastus Snow [1841–47], Historical Department, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City, pp. 3–5.)"],["div",{"id":"p42","uri":"/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-110-121/section-111-the-greatest-treasure.p42"},"Later entries in his journal show that Elder Snow baptized over one hundred people from the time he arrived in Salem until he returned to Nauvoo on 11 April 1843.

The Revelation was given at Salem, the county seat of Essex County, Massachusetts. It was in that county that Robert Smith, the first of the Smith family in America, settled. It was the residence of many more of the pioneer immigrants to America, whose descendants joined the Church. At Salem, the county seat, the records for all the towns in the county were kept, and the Smiths’ record, among others, were there.
