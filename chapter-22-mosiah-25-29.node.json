Many of the rising generation were not converted to the gospel and would not believe the words of the prophets. Alma the Younger and the four sons of King Mosiah were among those who did not believe, and they went about seeking to destroy the Church of God. Through fervent prayer, Alma received direction from the Lord on how to proceed regarding those who dissented from the Church. Throughout this lesson, you can help students see the change that comes through repentance and conversion.
